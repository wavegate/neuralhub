conditionally immortal DRG cell line from the Immortomouse
cel lline MED17.11 express markers of cells committed to the sensory neuron lineage

within few hours under differentiating conditions, MED17.11 cells extend processes and following seven days of differentiation, express markers of more mature DRG neurons such as NaV1.7 and Piezo2
The cells respond to capsaicin, veratridine, with robust calcium transients in the presence of inflammatory mediators bradykinin, histamine and norepinephrine
