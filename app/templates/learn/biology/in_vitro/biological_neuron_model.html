biological nueron models ,also known as spiking neuron models, are mathematical descriptions of properties of certain cells in the nervous system that generate electrical potentials across their cell membrane
the most detailed mathematical models are biophysical neuron models (also called Hodgkin-Huxley models) that describe the membrane voltage as a function of the input current and the activation of ion channels
integrate-and-fire models are mathematically simpler and describe the membrane voltage as a function of the input current and predict spike times without a description of the biophysical processes that shape the time course of an action potential
extracellular measurement has several advantages: easier to obtain experimentally, robust and lasts a long time, and can reflect the dominant effect
two categories of neuron models: electrical input-output membrane voltage models and natural stimulus or pharmacological input neuron models

the Hodgkin-Huxley model (H&H model) models the relationship between the flow of ionic currents across the neuronal cell membrane and the membrane voltage of the cell
consists of a set of nonlinear differential equations describing the behavior of ion channls that permeate the cell membrane of the squid giant axon
