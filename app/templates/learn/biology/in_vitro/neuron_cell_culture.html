mature neurons do not undergo cell division
establish cell lines that are derived from neuronal tumors
SH-SY5Y was derived from parental metastatic bone tumor biopsy cell line SK-N-SH in the 1970s
they grow as undifferentiated neuroblast-like cells and express immature neuronal markers
they can be differentiated by agents to become more similar to primary neurons
NT2, or NTera is neuronally committed teratocarcinoma cell line that is able to be induced into neuronal culture by treatment with retinoic acid and inhibitors of mitosis
PC12 is a rat cell line derived from pheochromocytoma which differentiate into neuronal phenotype when treated with NGF

primary cell cultures are not immortal and it is necessary to separate the cell tyep of interest from other cells and determine the purity of the resulting cultures
must separate from astrocytes and oligodendrocytes
must obtain necessary ethical protocol approvals

there are established protocols for the isolation of enteric neurons from animals
two methods to obtain enteric neurons from mouse myenteric plexus: direct culture of primary neurons and induction of neuronal differentiation of enteric neural stem/progenitor cells

isolation, propagation, storage, and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSC) and neural precursor cells (NPC) from rat fetal spinal cords
preparation of neuroepithelial cells (NEPs) from rat spinal cord and preparation of Neuronal Restricted Progenitors (NRPs) and Glial Restricted Progenitor (GRPs) from E13.5 rat spinal cord
NEPs are multipotent cells that can self renew in vivo and can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes

another way is starting from commercially available culture of normal human astrocytes (NHA) isolated from normal fetal human brain tissue
some of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes have stem cell properties and the genesis of neurona lineage cells from NHA in adherent culture can be induced by removal of serum and addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
later mature into neurons after withdrawal of bFGF
in vitro system containing of both neurons and glia, thought of as "human brain in a dish"

an alternative is to place unseparated sections of tissue into culture, known as ex vivo culturing or slice culturing
allows valuable means of studying neuronal/glial biology within a physiologically relevant tissue context
viable for as long as several weeks
membrane-interface method of brain slice culture
involves the placement of explanted rodent brain slices upon a semporous membrane insert, which sits in a well containing medium such that the slices are suspended at the interface between medium and humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 36 C
a thin film of medium forms above the slices by capillary action, thus allowing not only hydration and nutrition but also gaseous exchange to maintain availability for several weeks

in determining the purity of the culture
number of markers used for lineage-specific markers: BIII-tubulin for neuronal cells, GFAP for astrocytic cells, O4 for oligodendrocytic cells and OX-42/CD-11b for microglial cells
Nestin and SOX2 for neuroprogenitor cells, NG2 for oligodendrocyte precursor cells
neurospheres and glial cell cultures: immunocytochemistry for cell phenotyping
Q-RT-PCR to detect and quantify expression of mRNA for lineage-specific markers has advantage of providing precise quantitation of marker expression but does not address what percentage of cells in a given culture are positive for a marker and hence should be used in addition to but not instead of IHC

substrate is important
The importance of the substrate in promoting or inhibiting neurite outgrowth in in vitro cultures of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is explored in the protocols described in Chapter 14 “Quantitative assessment of neurite outgrowth over growth promoting or inhibitory substrates” by George Smith and coworkers.

composition of growth factors and serum is important
