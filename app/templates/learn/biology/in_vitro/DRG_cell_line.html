DRGâ€™s contain different classes of primary sensory neurons including pain-associated nociceptive neurons, non-nociceptive temperature sensing, mechanosensory and chemoreceptive neurons, as well as multiple types of immune and endothelial cells. This cell-population heterogeneity makes investigations of individual subgroups of DRG neurons, such as nociceptors, difficult.

dissociation of DRG neurons by fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic beads produces low neuronal yields and requires a high number of lab animals

only a handful of DRG-derived immortalized sensory neuronal cell lines have been generated: F-11, ND-C, and ND7/23, the mouse cell line MED17.11, rat cell line 50B11, and human HD10.6 cells
often these cells do not recaptiulate specific DRG neuron subtypes such as peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors and analysis of calcium responses to nociceptor-related agonists and RNAseq studies have demonstrated marked differences between available DRG-derived cell lines and naive, primary cultured DRG neurons

F-11 Cells
sensory neurons isolated from rat DRG at embryonic days 13-14 fused with mouse neuroblastoma cell line N18TG2 via exposure to 55% polyethylenglycol for 2 min
somatic hybrids initially grown in Ham's F-12 meduim with addition of hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine to elminate parent neuroblastoma N18TG2 which does not express hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
only the differentiated F-11 cell line produced action potentials similar to sensory nociceptive DRG neurons, contained substance P-like immunoreactivity and responded to capsaicin
sorting of undifferentiated F-11 cells by flow cytometry sohwed two main populations of cells: larger, less granular, and smaller cells
do not express TrpA1 and TrpV4 but do express TrpV2
do not express CGRP
