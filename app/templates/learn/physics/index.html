<li>Permutations and Combinations</li>
<p>Permutations and combinations, as taught in middle/high school, are about figuring out how many ways you can select items from a set. I think this is often a confusing thing to learn because it's taught disjointedly from other subjects, and involves fairly fundamental aspects of math that are not taught in elementary math, and requires a different way of thinking. It's not really algebra, but is about combinators, or counting. So fundamentally we have to go back away from the fancy symbols we have been using, and just focus on counting things. In addition, it applies some stuff from probability with independent/dependent events. However, it has very obvious application which makes it interesting to teach. For example, if you technically enter all permutations of characters into a password field, you should be able to hack every online account ever created. However, with a quick understanding of permutations, you realize  that is not likely.</p>
<p>The first thing we can talk about is permutations with repetitions. How many ways can you order a set of numbers? If your set of numbers is {a, b, c}, then you can arrange them {a, a, a}, {b, b, b}, {c, c, c}, {a, a, b}... and so forth. I think about it this way. If you look at the first "slot", how many options do you have there? You have 3... a, b, or c. Now, if you pick a, then think about how many options you have for the second slot, you have 3 again... a, b, or c. So then for every option for the 1st slot, we have 3 options for the second slot. So in total, we have 3*3=9 options for the first two slots. Then, for each option in the first two slots, we have 3 options for the 3rd slot, so then we have 3*3*3=27 total possibilities. This is the equation for permutations with repetitions: \(n^r\). n here is the total size of the original set we are picking from {a, b, c}. If our initial set was all the letters of the alphabet, n here would be 26. If our initial set was a deck of playing cards without jokers, it would be 52. r here is how many we are putting in order. So if we said, how many ways can you arrange 2 numbers from {a, b, c, d}, then it would be \(n^r=4^2=16\).</p>
<p>So then let's look at permutations without repetitions. This time, if we pick "a" for our first option, we can't pick it again for our second slot. In the case of choosing 3 out of {a, b, c}, you can arrange them {a, b, c}, {a, c, b}, {b, a, c}, {b, c, a}, {c, a, b}, {c, b, a}. This is kind of the more natural answer to the question, how many ways can you arrange a bunch of items? In total, there are 6 possible ways to arrange these numbers. So let's think about this in terms of slots again. In the first slot, we can choose any option. Then, in the second slot, you have one fewer option, so you now have n-1 options. Then in the third slot, you have n-2 options because you have taken 2 out already, and so forth... So as we go on, we realize the answer to how many options is \(n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...\). This is also termed \(n!\), or n-factorial. But that's not our answer quite yet. Let's say we only want to arrange 2 items from a set of 4. In this case, we are just doing 4 * (4-1). We don't care about the (4-2) and (4-3) because we're stopping after 2. What we notice here is (4-2) and (4-3) can be written as \(2*1 = 2!\). So we take n, subtract r, and that gives us the factorial that we need to remove because we don't care about them. So our ending equation for permutations without repetitions is \(n!/(n-r)!\).</p>
<p>Now we will discuss combinations without repetition. The difference between combination and permutation is that for combinations, we don't care about the order. So whereas before with permutations, {a, b, c} was different from {c, b, a}, we now consider these to just be one option. So from our list of permutations without repetition, all we need to do is remove the ones which are simply permutations of each unique combination. Good news, though, is that we just did that! The number of ways we can arrange r numbers is just \(r!\). So the equation for combinations without repetitions is just the equation for permutations without repetitions divided by \(r!\), aka \(\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\).</p>
<p>Finally, we get to combinations with repetitions. In this case, we don't care about the order, but we can repeat getting one number more than once. Imagine this: you are at an ice cream parlor, and there are 4 different ice cream flavors you can choose from... {a, b, c, d}, and you get 3 scoops total for your ice cream cone. Now imagine there is a robot behind ice cream "a", and your job is to tell him whether to scoop up ice cream or move over to the right to the next ice cream flavor. We will imagine "O" means scoop up ice cream, and ">" means to move over to the right. How would we scoop up 3 scoops of "a"? It would just be OOO>>>. The robot would take 3 scoops of "a", and then move over all the way to the right. What if we wanted one scoop of "a" and 2 scoops of "d"? Then it would be O>>>OO. What you'll realize is that for each set of instructions, we will get a different combinations (with repetitions) of ice cream flavors. If OOO>>> means three scoops of "a", there is no other set of instructions we can give that will also give us three scoops of "a". Therefore, all we need to do to find the combinations with repetitions is to find how many ways we can position the "O"s throughout our instructions OOO>>>. But wait! We already know how to do that! There are 6 positions total. And we need to pick 3 of those positions. The order doesn't matter, because they're all "O," but we can't repeat a single position more than once. So this is just combinations without repetitions, and we have that equation above... \(\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!}\), and that will be our answer. Now, the number of positions we have in total will always be \(n+r-1\), because we are taking r scoops and moving n-1 times to get to the end. And r stays the same. So our end equation for combinations with repetitions is \(\frac{(n+r-1)!}{r!(n+r-1-r)!}=\frac{(n+r-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}\).</p>
<p>So you can see here that working with combinatorics takes a bit more out of the box thinking, and requires a lot of visualization and imagining multiple iterations of similar things, which makes it inherently difficult. But also makes it super interesting!</p>
