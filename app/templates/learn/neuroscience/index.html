<h1>Neuroscience</h1>
<h4>Critical periods</h4>
<p>A critical period is a concept in developmental psychology and developmental biology which suggests that there is a
	maturational stage in the lifespan of an organism during which the nervous system is especially sensitive to certain
	environmental stimuli. More concrete examples of critical periods in humans involve the visual, hearing and
	vestibular systems.</p>
<h4>Monocular deprivation</h4>
<p>David H. Hubel and Torsten Wisel (1963) showed that cats that had one eye sewn shut from birth to three months of age
	only fully developed vision in the open eye, and that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the
	other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. Electrophysiological analyses
	of axons and neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus, however, showed the receptive field properties were
	comparable to normal cats, but had less activity and fewer responses. The kittens had abnormally small ocular
	dominance columns connected to the closed eye and abnormally large wide columns connected to the open eye. Adult
	cats even when one eye was sewn shut for a year, did not have this problem.</p>
<h4>Pacinian corpuscle</h4>
<p>The Pacinian corpuscle, or lamellar corpuscle, or Vater-Pacini corpuscle, is a type of specialized nerve ending
	primarily responsivle for detecting vibration. They are rapidly acting and respond only to sudden disturbances and
	especially sensitive to vibration of few hundreds of Hz. This vibration may be useful for detecting surface texture,
	e.g. rough vs smooth. They detect stimuli due to deformation of their lamellae, which triggers leakage of sodium
	ions.</p>

<li>Bioelectricity</li>
<p>Most of the experiments investigating ion concentrations were originally done on the giant squid axon. The key to the
	resting potential of neuron membranes is that there are ion concentration differences from inside to outside of the
	cell. These differences are generated by active transporters. Inside of the mammalian (not squid) neuron, potassium
	(in mM) is 140, sodium is 5-15, chloride is 4-30, and calcium is 0.0001. Outside of the cell, potassium is 5, sodium
	is 145, chloride is 110, and calcium is 1-2. Remember that when I say potassium here, I mean KCl, or potassium
	chloride. So from inside to outside of the cell, there is no potential difference, beecause every KCl has a positive
	K+ and a negative Cl-, and every NaCl has a positive Na+ and a negative Cl-. However, when you make the membrane
	between the inside and outside permeable to just K+ ions (not allowing Cl-), then K+ will naturally want to leave
	from inside of the cell (140 mM) to outside (5 mM) because of the concentration gradient. Therefore, as potassium
	ions leave the inside of the cell, there is a buildup of positive charge outside of the cell, and a buildup of
	negative charge inside the cell. The potential difference created by these charges end up around -58 mV (from inside
	to outside). If, instead, the membrane was permeable to Na+, then the potential will end up being about +20 mV
	(because Na+ outside would flow into the cell).</p>
<p>So what is this mathematically? We'll take a closer look at the Nernst-Planck equation.
	$$V_m=\frac{RT}{zF}\ln{\frac{[x]_\text{outside}}{[x]_\text{inside}}}$$</p>
<p>So logically, we want to accommodate this equilibrium effect of having a concentration gradient. We have ions trying
	to move outside of the cell towards a lower concentration, but after that movement accumulates a certain amount of
	charge, the electrophoretic effect (the effect of an electric field on an ion) starts to pull those ions back. So
	basically we have two different forces pushing the ions to flow out or into the neuron.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the forces pushing ions down their concentration gradient. This can be described by Fick's first
	law of diffusion, which relates diffusive flux to the gradient of the concentration. Before I go any further, let me
	define what flux means. Flux is the amount of anything that passes through a certain area given an amount of time,
	with the dimensions \(\frac{quantity}{time*area}\). Now let's discuss gradient. If you think about gradient of
	color, you can imagine a rectangle gradually changing from black to white... a black-to-white gradient. At each
	point of the gradient, the color is slowly changing, tiny bit by tiny bit, from black to white. If you take the
	derivative of that gradient, you can see how much the color is changing at an infinitely small change in position,
	which we label as x. Now, when we talk about the concentration gradient across a membrane, we're doing the same
	thing, except there is a huge difference in concentration at that tiny transition from inside to outside of the
	cell, aka the membrane. The concentration gradient in this case is not gradual, but rather sharp, kind of like jump
	discontinuity in graphs, except not exactly because there technically is a distance (thickness of the membrane)
	through which the ions need to diffuse through to get from the high concentration to low concentration. So let's
	replace concentration difference and this distance with variables. We get the concentration gradient across the
	membrane is \(\frac{dC}{dx}\), which means the change in concentration, over change in position.</p>
<p>Okay, so we got the concentration gradient into our calculation of flux. But there are other variables as well that
	describe how ions move across any structure. These include temperature, viscosity, and size of the ions. However, to
	simplify these, we will combine them into one variable, which we will call the diffusion coefficient, or diffusivity
	symbolized as "D". So, together our equation for diffusive flux is just a combination of our diffusivity and our
	concentration gradient. So for each mole of ions we have, $$M_d=-D\frac{dC}{dx}$$</p>
<p>To clarify, \(M_d\) here is molar flux from diffusion. In other words, how many moles of ions dissolve through the
	membrane per units of area and time. So we don't really care about how big our membrane is, nor how long we leave
	the ions there. We're just looking at the number of ions moving through at a snapshot of time and space. You will
	also notice that this is negative. This is just a sign convention where we are comparing inside (higher
	concentration) to outside (lower concentration). Since concentration is decreasing, the derivative is going to be
	negative. </p>
<p>So now we have the flux from the concentration gradient, now let's look at the flux from the electric gradient. From
	the ions inside to the ions outside, there is an electrical gradient across a certain amount of space. We'll call
	this \(\frac{d\phi}{dx}\). This potential is multiplied by a variable of ion mobility \(\mu\). Finally, the greater
	the concentration of ions we have, the more flux we will have due to the electrophoretic effect. And hence, the
	molar flux from electrophoretic effect is below. Note again that we have a negative because the positive charges of
	K+ follow negative potentials, so the more negative the potential difference is, the more flux there should be. So:
	$$M_e=-\mu C\frac{d\phi}{dx}$$.</p>
<p>So now we have both the molar electric flux and the concentration flux, which is the number of moles of ions passing
	through a given time and space. To find the amount of charge passing through, we just multiple this number by
	Faraday's constant, which is the amount of electric charge of one mole of electrons (in this case, we're talking
	about K+ ions, but they should be the same absolute value). So the current passing through is equal to:
	$$I=M_{K^+}zF=-zF(D\frac{dC}{dx}+\mu C\frac{d\phi}{dx})$$</p>
<p>Now, we use Einstein's relationship for mobility: $$\mu=\frac{DxF}{RT}$$, where \(\mu\) is mobility, R is gas
	constant, T is absolute temperature, D is diffusivity, and x is position.</p>
<p>After recognizing that the current, which we've found so far, is actually 0 at equilibrium, we set everything to
	zero, and integrate the local potential from inside to outside of the membrane, and plug in the constants R, T, and
	F and find that:
	$$\phi_\text{inside}-\phi_\text{outside}=\frac{58}{z}\ln\frac{[K^+]\text{inside}}{[K^+]\text{outside}}$$</p>
<li>Chemical basis of electrical signals</li>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/voltageclamp.png') }}">
<p>Let's talk about the voltage clamp. You have an electrode inside of the axon (in this case a squid giant axon due to
	its large size - NOT a giant squid axon... I do wonder how large a giant squid giant axon would be) and a reference
	electrode outside of the axon to measure the membrane potential. That membrane potential is compared to a command
	voltage (the voltage you want to set the voltage to), which will go through a voltage clamp amplifier and will send
	a current into the axon until the measured potential is equal to the command voltage. Basically, we are adding
	current to the inside of an axon until the membrane potential is whatever we want it to be. Then, with Kirchhoff's
	current law, we know that whatever current we're adding to the inside of the axon must be going out of the axon
	through the membrane. So then we can measure the current passing through the membrane at a given voltage.</p>
<p>So let's say we want the command voltage to be set to -130 mV. This means the system will add a current until we
	hyperpolarize the membrane by an additional -65 mV (from a -65 mV resting potential). Since we're hyperpolarizing,
	the current technically is in reverse, which means we're pulling positive ions (remember here we're talking about
	hole current which follows positive ions) out of the axon.</p>
<p>Realize that the membrane functions as a capacitor. There are charges building up inside of the membrane, and charges
	building up outside of the membrane, and these charges are separated by an insulator, hence making the membrane and
	its charges a capacitor.</p>
<p>As we hyperpolarize the cell by pulling positive ions out, there is a similar inward membrane current.</p>
<p>Now let's say we want to depolarize the cell from -65 resting potential to 0. Now we need to add 65 mV to the inside
	of the cell. So a current is added via the electrode, which, again, due to Kirchhoff's current law (KCL), means
	current is pushed through the membrane (an instantaneous capacitive current as the voltage adjusts). The capacitive
	current is basically the addition of charges onto the capacitor. Since at rest, the inside of the membrane has more
	negative charge, there is an addition of positive ions to bring that difference from inside to outside to zero. That
	is the capacitive current. Now, the fun doesn't stop there. Now that the membrane is depolarized, we then see a
	transient inward current, which is the opening of sodium channels letting sodium ions back into the cell. These
	channels open because they are voltage-gated. Remember that at rest, there is a lot more sodium outside of the cell
	than inside. So if you open those channels up, sodium will start coming in. This is termed the "transient inward
	current" (TIC). Because sodium is positive, this adds additional positive charges into the cell. Then after a
	millisecond or two, those sodium channels close and voltage-gated potassium channels open letting potassium ions out
	of the cell. This delayed outward current (DOC) will typically repolarize the membrane. However, if we keep the
	voltage clamped to 0, this outward current will continue for as long as we have the voltage clamped as the potassium
	channels do not close.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/depolarize.png') }}">
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/currents.png') }}">
<p>One observation to make here is that if you depolarize the membrane to +20 or higher (equilibrium potential if sodium
	was permeable), you will notice that there is essentially no inward sodium current even though the conductance is
	high, because the sodium outside of the cell doesn't want to come down its concentration gradient because the inside
	of the cell is already too high voltage.</p>
<p>These currents can be isolated from each other by applying TTX (to block Na+ current) and TEA (to block K+ current).
</p>
<p>Key electrical properties of neuronal membrane that determine neuronal excitability include membrane resistance,
	capacitance, and time constant, which are consequences of charge separation and capacitive properties of the
	membrane. These properties dictate current-evoked voltage changes across the membrane. The resting membrane
	potential is determined by leak conductances and summation of the equilibrium potentials of their respective ions,
	as well as the relative concentration of impermeable ions across the membrane. Excitability can be quantified in
	many ways, such as rheobase (minimum stimulus intensity capable of evoking an action potential), action potential
	voltage threshold, or correlations with passive membrane properties.</p>
<li>Spatio-temporal propagation</li>
<p>Now let's talk about how an electric signal propagates down the axon. Say you put an extracellular electrode,
	adjacent to but not touching the axon, and drive a current into the neuron. And along the axon, you place
	intracellular electrodes to measure the electric potential inside the cell. You will see a particular waveform going
	across the axon, decreasing as it gets farther from your stimulation point, exponentially, due to leakage of current
	out of the axon. Note that the shape is not a square wave (which is what you would stimulate with).</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/propagation.png') }}">
<p>Let's talk about the shape. If the neuron membrane was purely resistive, the graph of the membrane potential should
	be linear. But instead, we observe a ramping behavior that is similar to a capacitor. Next, you will notice that as
	we get farther from the stimulation site (say 2 mm away), there is a delay before the potential change.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/attenuation.png') }}">
<p>Now let's look at the amplitude of potential change as a function of distance. This equation is exponential, modeled
	by the equation \(V_0e^{-x/\lambda}\). Lambda (\(\lambda\)) is the space, or length, constant:
	\(\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{r_M}{r_i}}\), which depends on the resistance of the membrane and the resistances of the fluid
	inside of the cell. So if you have high membrane resistance, current will flow more slowly out of the axon as it
	travels, leading to a slower decrease of potential along the distance of the axon. In other words, the higher the
	space constant, the slower the potential is going to decrease exponentially. You can also imagine if the resistance
	of the fluid in the cell is very high, most of the current will want to travel through the membrane, leading to a
	fast drop in membrane potential.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/space.png') }}">
<p>Additionally, there is a time constant to how the potential changes. The time constant is defined as \(\tau=r_Mc_M\),
	or essentially the product of the membrane resistance and the membrane capacitance. The larger the time constant
	(aka the larger the capacitance of the membrane), the longer it takes for the voltage to ramp up.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/time.png') }}">
<p>Now, what we've discussed so far is all passive conduction, based on passive properties of the membrane. There is
	also active conduction, which is the triggering of action potentials (sodium channels opening to let in positive
	charge and potassium channels opening to let out positive charge). These action potentials are triggered constantly
	so each signal is propagated down the axon. In certain neurons, however, exist Schwann cells (in the peripheral
	nervous system) or oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system), which surround chunks of the axon essentially
	insulating the axon, thereby both increasing the membrane resistance to prevent current flow (and thereby increasing
	the space constant which means a slower decrease in potential change the farther we get) as well as to prevent
	action potentials except at certain areas where there are "holes" in the insulation to allow action potentials to
	propagate. Therefore, myelin allows the axons to take advantage of both the speed of passive conduction and the
	ability of active conduction to recreate signals.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/saltatory.png') }}">
<p>Now remember that passive conduction is inherently faster than active conduction. If we myelinate the axons, we
	increase membrane resistance thereby increasing the space constant thereby increasing the potential difference
	farther away from the stimulation site. So with myelination we spee
	<p>So what happens if you damage myelination? This occurs, for example, in multiple sclerosis. Well, what happens is
		that the action potentials propagating down might not be able to reach the next node (not sure how this works,
		maybe the myelin covers too much sometimes?) or the action potential will not be in sync with the other nerve
		fibers in the bundle.</p>
	<li>Patch clamping</li>
	<p>So patch clamping is a technique developed in the 1950s to 1960s. You take a glass capillary tube and melt and
		then pull the end so that it becomes super sharp. You break the end off and you will get an inner diameter at
		the tip of a few microns. You then put that tube onto a stereotaxic frame to allow yourself to control it
		carefully, because you'll need to lower that tip down into your neurons until it touches the membrane but
		doesn't break into the cell. You apply suction to the end of the tube to create a seal between the tube and the
		membrane, creating an insulated electrical environment. Then, if you have ion channels in that patch you are
		clamped to, you could study those individual ion channels.</p>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/patchclamp.png') }}">
	<p>You could also apply stronger suction to break the membrane open, allowing you to record that intracellular
		environment exposed (whole-cell recording if the cell is small). You could also pull back on the pipette,
		thereby pulling off the patch of membrane, which allows you to manipulate the inside of the patch and study the
		ion channels (inside-out recording). If you apply stronger suction to break the membrane open, and then pull
		back on the pipette (aka tube), the membrane will flip inside out, allowing you to manipulate the extracellular
		domain of the ion channels (outside-out recording).</p>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/clamping.png') }}">
	<p>With this patch clamp technique, we can measure microscopic currents through small groups of ion channels. If we
		sum all of these currents up, we will see that they sum to something that looks like the transient inward
		current (for sodium) and the delayed outward current (for potassium).</p>
	<p>Now, you might wonder, what is the threshold membrane potential for an ion channel to open? Although there is
		approximately one value, there is actually a distribution across individual ion channels opening. As shown
		below, most sodium and potassium ion channels open by the time the membrane potential reaches 0mV or higher.</p>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/summed.png') }}">
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/summedK.png') }}">
	<p>There are different types of ion channels. When talking about action potentials, we've been talking about
		voltage-gated ion channels. There are also ligand-gated ion channels, that require something to bind to them for
		them to open. There are also mechanically gated ion channels. For example, our touch receptors like the Meissner
		corpuscle has mechanically-gated ion channels that open up when the channel is physically stretched apart. For
		taste receptors, the chemicals that we have on our tongue activate an intracellular cascade via a G-protein
		receptor, which activate ion channels. There are also heat-activated ion channels that allow calcium to enter
		the cell and trigger an action potential. Capsaicin can also go through the membrane and open up these
		heat-activated ion channels from the inside. So when you eat spicy food and hot food at the same time, those add
		to each other and make things feel even worse.</p>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/touch.png') }}">
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/taste.png') }}">
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/capsaicin.png') }}">
	<p>Hair cells in the ear also allow for mechanically-gated ion channels to trigger an action potential based on
		sound waves. Interestingly, there is another set of hair cells outside of the inner hair cells which don't pick
		up sounds but actually generate sounds, which can actually be picked up by a microphone. The purpose of this
		second layer is to dynamically stiffen the membrane of the cochlea to allow you to change the gain (automatic
		gain control).</p>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/ear.png') }}">
	<p>In our sight receptors in our eye, darkness triggers cGMP which leads to an action potential. This process is
		reversed when they are exposed to light, leading to breakdown of cGMP and no action potentials. So technically,
		we don't see light... we see darkness.</p>
	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/neuroscience/rods.png') }}">
	<li>Post-synaptic receptors</li>
	<p>So people found that there is chemical transmission between nerves. What they did was take two frog hearts and
		immersed them into solution. They stimulated one frog heart and found a change in contraction. They then took
		the liquid out of that container and put it into the other heart, and found the second heart also started to
		change in contraction force, thereby showing that the signal was transmitted in the liquid.</p>
	<p>Even if a postsynaptic potential increases relative to the resting potential, it can still be inhibitory as long
		as it is lower than the threshold for an action potential. It is called inhibitory because it decreases the
		average potential at the axon hillock relative to the threshold.</p>
