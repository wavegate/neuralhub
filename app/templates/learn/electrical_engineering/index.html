    <h2>Electronics</h2>
    <h3>Engineering Circuit Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Ohm's Law</h4>
    $$V=iR$$
    <h4>Resistors in Series and Parallel</h4>
    <p>Resistors in series can be summed to form their total resistance.</p>
    <p>Resistors in parallel follow the following equation:</p>
    $$\frac{1}{R_\text{total}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}...$$
    <p>If you only have two resistors in parallel, you can cheat and use the heuristic "product over sum":</p>
    $$R_\text{total}=\frac{R_1*R_2}{R_1+R_2}$$
    <h4>Kirchhoff's Current Law</h4>
    <p>Kirchhoff's current law states that the current going into a node is equal to the current going out of a node.
    </p>
    <h4>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law</h4>
    <p>Kirchhoff's voltage law states that the voltage drops around any loop in a circuit is equal to 0.</p>
    <h4>Voltage Divider</h4>
    <p>A voltage divider is simply splitting up a voltage source across more than one resistor.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/voltage_divider.svg')}}" style="width: 30%">
    <p>We know that the total resistance across two resistors is the sum. So we can find the current going through both
        resistors.</p>
    $$i=\frac{V_1}{R_1+R_2}$$
    <p>Which means the voltage drop across any single resistor (say across resistor 1) is:</p>
    $$V=\frac{V_1}{R_1+R_2}*R_1=V_1(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2})$$
    <p>Basically, the voltage drop across any resistor in series is proportional to the size of that resistor. You can
        imagine that this can allow you to divide any single voltage sorce into separate voltage drops using differently
        sized resistors.</p>
    <h4>Current Divider</h4>
    <p>If you have current splitting into two paths, the current going through path 1 is equal to the input current
        times
        the proportion of the resistance of path 2 to the resistance of the 2 paths combined. It's just like the voltage
        divider except you use the resistance of the other path (the higher the resistance of the other path, the higher
        your current through your path).</p>
    $$i_1=i_\text{tot}(\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2})$$
    <h4>Node Voltage Method</h4>
    <p>For node voltage, you choose a reference node, and then look at any essential nodes. An essential node is a node
        with three or more components. You then do KCL on each essential node.</p>
    <h4>Mesh Current Method</h4>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/1.png')}}">
    <p>So the mesh current solution method is basically Kirchhoff's Voltage Law but for each "mesh" or cookie in the
        circuit. You can imagine the circuit as a cookie cutter. In the example above, if you use this design as a
        cookie
        cutter, you will cut up a cookie in 3 square chunks, each of which we define as a mesh. Now we define a current
        running clockwise around each mesh, and add up the voltage drops in that current, then set the sum of those
        voltage
        drops to 0 due to Kirchhoff's voltage law.</p>
    $$0=V_1+i_a*R_1+(i_a-i_b)*R_2 = -40+i_a*2+(i_a-i_b)*8$$
    $$40=2i_a+8i_a-8i_b=10i_a-8i_b$$
    <p>Notice that the voltage drop across R2 uses the summation of \(i_a\) and \(i_b\), but \(i_b\) is running in the
        opposite direction so it is negative. Also note that our sign convention for positive voltage drop is from
        positive
        to negative, so the negative to positive voltage source V1 is negative.</p>
    $$0=(i_b-i_a)*R_2+i_b*R_3+(i_b-i_c)*R_5$$
    $$0=8i_b-8i_a+6i_b+6i_b-6i_c=-8i_a+20i_b-6i_c$$
    $$0=(i_c-i_b)*R_5+i_c*R_4+20$$
    $$-20=6i_c-6i_b+4i_c=-6i_b+10i_c$$
    <p>So, in summary, the mesh equations are:</p>
    $$\text{Mesh a: }40=10i_a-8i_b$$
    $$\text{Mesh b: }0=-8i_a+20i_b-6i_c$$
    $$\text{Mesh c: }-20=-6i_b+10i_c$$
    <p>Which means, to solve this, just need to do some matrix algebra:</p>
    $$\begin{bmatrix}10 & -8 & 0 & | & 40 \\ -8 & 20 & -6 & | & 0 \\ 0 & -6 & 10 & | & -20\end{bmatrix}$$
    <p>This will give us \(i_a=5.6\), \(i_b=2\), and \(i_c=-0.8\). Once you have these currents, you can solve for
        everything else.</p>
    <h4>Source Transformations</h4>
    <p>The first source transformation (basically equivalent circuit pieces) is the ability to convert a voltage source
        and its resistance in series to a current source and its resistance in parallel. These are essentially the same
        thing. This means that no matter what load you place at the ends, you'll get the same current running through
        the
        load and the same voltage drop across the load. You can confirm this by testing a short circuit (just a wire)
        and an
        open circuit (no load).</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/3.png')}}">
    <p>In this case, the value of the new current source can be calculated with Ohm's law: i = V/R.</p>
    <p>Also note that if there is a voltage source in parallel with a resistor, you can ignore that resistor. The
        voltage
        source will always produce enough current to pass through the load, and the voltage drop across the load will be
        the
        same. In the same way, if you have a current source in series with a resistor, you can ignore that resistor. The
        current source will always produce enough current to negate that resistor.</p>
    <p>So, applying this along with simplifying resistors in series and parallel, we can simplify a long circuit into a
        shorter one.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/5.svg')}}" width=80%>
    <p>So let's simplify the circuit above. The question asks for V1, so let's not combine that resistor just yet. We
        can
        transform the two left voltage sources into current sources.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/6.svg')}}" width=80%>
    <p>Then, we can combine the resistors in parallel, and combine the current sources in parallel. Then transform back
        into a voltage source.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/7.svg')}}" width=80%>
    <p>Now you can just find the voltage of V1 via a voltage divider. Answer found!</p>
    <h4>Thevenin Equivalent Circuits</h4>
    <p>A Thevenin equivalent circuit is basically doing a "source" transformation for an entire circuit, converting
        power
        sources, resistors, inductors, and capacitors into one "black box" element. The only factors that can be taken
        out
        of this equivalent circut are the Thevenin equivalent Voltage (VTH) and the Thevenin equivalent resistance
        (RTH).
        These values are found using the Kirchhoff laws, mesh current, or node voltage methods to solving circuits.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/thevenin.svg')}}" width=60%>
    <p>The Thevenin equivalent voltage is the open circuit voltage across a and b, meaning the voltage drop between the
        two terminals when there is no circuit in between them. The Thevenin equivalent resistance can be calculated
        from
        the current running through a short circuit, or just a wire, between a and b.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/thevenin_2.svg')}}">
    <p>So let's find the Thevenin equivalents for the circuit above. The first thing we can do is find the Thevenin
        equivalent voltage VTH. We can find this by using mesh currents while the circuit between a and b is open, aka
        what
        is the voltage drop across a and b.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/thevenin_3.svg')}}">
    <p>Remember that with the mesh current method, we are solving for the currents running through each mesh. Since the
        only source of current in i1 is a current source, we already know the current!</p>
    $$\text{Mesh 1}: i_1=3$$
    $$\text{Mesh 2}: 0=150*(i_2-i_1)+10*i_2+40*(i_2-i_3)$$
    $$0=150i_2-150i_1+10i_2+40i_2-40i_3$$
    $$-150i_1+200i_2-40i_3=0$$
    $$\text{Mesh 3}: 0=-300+40*(i_3-i_2)+8*i_3$$
    $$0=-300+40i_3-40i_2+8i_3$$
    $$-40i_2+48i_3=300$$
    $$
    \left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\
    -150 & 200 & -40 & 0 \\
    0 & -40 & 48 & 300
    \end{array}\right]
    $$
    <p>Solving this system of equations gives us \(i_1=3\), \(i_2=4.2\), \(i_3=9.75\).</p>
    <p>Now, we know that the voltage drop from a to b is the same as the voltage drop across the 10 ohm and 8 ohm
        resistors.</p>
    $$V_{\text{TH}}=10*i_2+8*i_3=10*4.2+8*9.75=120$$
    <p>To find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, we can do this two ways. One, we can find the current going through a
        wire between a and b. To do that, we could create a new mesh bordering a and b and use the mesh current method.
    </p>
    <p>Another way is to remove all power sources from the circuit by turning voltage sources into short circuits and
        all
        current sources into open circuits, and then finding the equivalent resistance through the circuit.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/thevenin_4.svg')}}">
    <p>Although they are drawn perpendicular, the 40 ohm resistor and the 8 ohm resistor are actually in parallel (you
        can
        imagine rotating the 8 ohm resistor sideways), so their equivalent resistance becomes 320/48 = 6.66. Then you
        just
        have 6.66 in series with 10 ohm resistor, which totals 16.66, which is in parallel with 150 ohm resistor, giving
        the
        equivalent resistance between a and b to be 15 ohms. So in the end, our solution is given:</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/thevenin_5.svg')}}" style="width: 80%">
    <p>Now, what if your circuit has dependent voltage/current sources? In this case, you can't just collapse all the
        resistors together to find the equivalent resistance. In this case, you attach a test source to a->b, much like
        as
        if you were testing the resistance using an ohmmeter (which runs a current through the circuit and calculates
        the
        resistance using Ohm's law).</p>
    <h4>Norton Equivalent Circuits</h4>
    <p>Norton equivalent circuit is just a Thevenin equivalent circuit that has undergone a source transformation to a
        current source + parallel resistor. Let's find the Norton equivalent circuit for the circuit shown below:</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/norton_1.svg')}}">
    <p>You'll notice that there is a wire connecting two circuits. This is a grounding wire. There is no actual current
        running through that wire. However, it makes sure that the "bottom" voltage of each circuit remains the same so
        that
        there is no huge potential difference between one circuit to the other. You can think of the analogy of a bunch
        of
        separate lakes. Each circuit is a lake of water floating in the sky. We don't want one lake to start
        accidentally
        floating down into another lake, so we make all the lakes stay at the same sea level. This prevents things like
        arcing (water flowing from one lake to another).</p>
    <p>Anyways, let's write the mesh current equations. Note that in the second equation, we know that i2 is simply
        -20i.
    </p>
    $$\text{Mesh 1: }0=-5+2000*i+3v$$
    $$\text{Mesh 2: }i_2=-20i$$
    <p>Finally, we notice that \(v=-20i*25=-500i\). So we can go back to Mesh 1.</p>
    $$0=-5+2000i-1500i=-5+500i$$
    $$i=0.01$$
    <p>So now we know that our voltage v is \(v=-20*0.01*25=-5\). You will notice that is the voltage drop between a and
        b
        in an open circuit, which means v is also the Thevenin equivalent voltage. So \(V_\text{TH}=-5\).</p>
    <p>So now we have to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance. Because of the dependent sources, we can't use the
        "remove all the sources and find the equivalent resistance" method. So we need to short circuit between a and b
        and
        find the current running through, and use that and Ohm's law to find the resistance.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/norton_2.svg')}}">
    <p>What you will find is that we can remove a couple of parts of our circuit once we do this. Now that we have short
        circuited a and b, there is no longer a current running through the 25 ohm resistor. So we can actually just
        remove
        that part of the circuit completely. Then, because there is no more voltage drop across that resistor (it's a
        short
        circuit!), our value of v is 0, and so the 3v voltage source also becomes 0, so we can simply remove that source
        and
        replace it with a wire.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/norton_3.svg')}}">
    <p>So our circuit now looks like the above. Notice that i is no longer the same as before because we added a short
        circuit to the system. But it should be pretty easy to see that \(i=5/2000=0.0025\), which means that the
        current
        running through a and b is \(-20*0.0025=-0.05\). Now that we have the current, we use Ohm's law, and get our
        resistance to be \(-5/-0.05=100\). So we conclude that our \(V_\text{TH}=-5\) and \(R_\text{TH}=-100\). Which
        means
        our Norton equivalents are \(i_\text{N}=-0.05\) and \(R_\text{N}=-100\) (in the drawing I can switch these to
        positive by flipping the current source upside down to travel from b to a).</p>

    <h4>Maximum Power Transfer</h4>
    <p>So if you have any circuit, and you want to add a load to that circuit, what resistance should your load be to
        give
        you the maximum power delivered from your circuit? For example, say you want to add a light bulb to your
        circuit.
        Should you make your light bulb high or low resistance? What people have found is that the maximum power is
        delivered to a load when the resistance of the load is equal to the Thevenin resistance of the circuit. If you
        think
        about it, if your load has 0 resistance, then there is 0 power delivered because \(P=iv=i^2R=0\). On the other
        hand,
        if your load has infinite resistance, then power again is 0 because then your current is 0. So the maximum power
        is
        somewhere in the middle, and it just happens to be when load is equal to the Thevenin equivalent resistance of
        the
        circuit. </p>
    <p>So what's the maximum power delivered in terms of our Thevenin equivalent voltage? That's pretty easy to figure
        out, since our entire circuit is just our Thevenin equivalent voltage, our Thevenin equivalent resistor, and our
        load resistor which is equal to the Thevenin equivalent resistor. So to find power, which is current times
        voltage...</p>
    $$i=\frac{V_\text{TH}}{2R_\text{TH}}$$
    $$P=i^2R=\frac{V_\text{TH}^2}{4R_\text{TH}}$$
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/power.svg')}}" style="width: 50%">
    <p>Let's take a look at the above circuit. Our goal here is to find the load resistance R such that we maximize the
        power delivered to that load. We know that to find this value, we just need to find the Thevenin equivalent
        resistance of our circuit. To do this, we short circuit any voltage sources and open circuit any current sources
        (of
        which we have none). Then, we apply a test current to the circuit, resulting in the circuit below:</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/power_2.svg')}}" style="width: 50%">
    <p>Now, you can use mesh current method to find the currents going through each resistor. Then, you know that the
        voltage drop across the test current is the same as the voltage drop going across the other two 4 ohm resistors
        in
        its mesh, which gives you the answer of 3 V. This means we need 3 V to send a 1 A current through the Thevenin
        equivalent resistor, meaning VTH is 3 Ohms, which is equal to the load R which maximizes the power delivered. If
        you
        want to then find the power, you would then need to set the load resistor to 3 Ohms and then find the current
        running through with mesh currents and use P=i^2R.</p>
    <h4>Superposition in Circuits</h4>
    <p>Superposition in circuits is useful for breaking down a circuit into parts. It is not so important to know how to
        do it if you have high computing power that can solve large matrices, but is more important if you have to do
        things
        by hand. What superposition means basically is that the voltage drop across each component in the circuit is the
        sum
        of the voltage drops due to each single power source. For example, say you have 5 voltage sources in your
        circuit.
        If you find the voltage across your component from each of those voltage sources, and then add them together,
        that
        will be the total voltage drop from all 5 voltage sources. It's kinda like the concept of summative potentials
        in
        neurons. You get all these action potentials going into the neuron via its dendrites, and at the axon hillock
        things
        get summed together to produce one big signal. In this case, each one of these action potentials is coming from
        a
        different voltage source in your circuit. This property of being able to sum all of these separate voltages is
        the
        property of a linear system, one in which you can add inputs together.</p>
    <p>As an aside, a circuit symbol with an arrow through it just means the component is variable.</p>
    <h4>Inductors</h4>
    <p>Inductors are circuit components that store energy in the form of a concentrated magnetic field. Any current
        through a wire produces a magnetic field. By coiling the current, it concentrates the magnetic field. This is
        what
        an inductor is. It is a coiled piece of wire. The units of an inductor is the Henry (kg*m2)/(s2A2), and
        inductors
        are labelled with the letter L. Understanding what exactly is going on with the magnetic field is an area of
        physics.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/inductor.svg')}}" style="width: 10%">
    <p>The voltage across an inductor is its inductance times the derivative of the current with respect to time, aka
        how
        fast the current changes through the inductor.</p>
    $$V=L\frac{di}{dt}$$
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/inductors.svg')}}" style="width: 20%">
    <p>So let's do some calculations for this simple circuit with just a current source and an inductor. For the sake of
        the exercise, let's set the current \(i=10te^{-5t}\).</p>
    <p>The first question is to sketch the current. We'll cheat here and just graph it with a calculator.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/inductors1.png')}}">
    <p>The second question is when is the current at its maximum?</p>
    <p>So, to defined the maximum of a function, you can set the derivative (slope) to zero. If the derivative is
        confusing to you, review some properties of derivatives in calculus under mathematics.</p>
    $$i=(10t)(e^{-5t})$$
    <p>We can split the function into two and use the product rule of derivatives.</p>
    $$\frac{di}{dt}=(10t)(e^{-5t})(-5)+(e^{-5t})(10)=0$$
    $$\frac{di}{dt}=-50t(e^{-5t})+10(e^{-5t})$$
    $$-50t+10=0$$
    $$t=0.2$$
    <p>So the maximum current is at 0.2 seconds.</p>
    <p>The next question is what is the equation for the voltage across the inductor?</p>
    $$V=L\frac{di}{dt}$$
    <p>Since we know both that \(L=0.1\) and the derivative of i with respect to t, the answer is simply:</p>
    $$V(t)=0.1*-50t(e^{-5t})+10(e^{-5t})$$
    $$V(t)=-5te^{-5t}+e^{-5t}$$
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/inductors2.png')}}">
    <p>So now we have plotted the voltage above. Compare it to the plot of the current, and recognize that the voltage
        is
        proportional to the rate of change of the current through the inductor.</p>
    <p>What if we want to do this backwards? What if we know the graph of the voltage, but want to find the current? In
        that case, we have to integrate the voltage over time.</p>
    $$V=L\frac{di}{dt}$$
    $$Vdt=Ldi$$
    $$\int{Vdt}=\int{Ldi}$$
    $$i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^t{V(t)dt}+i(0)$$
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/inductors3.svg')}}" style="width: 20%">
    <p>Alright, so now we've flipped the question backwards and let's solve for current from a given voltage function.
        Let's say \(V=20te^{-10t}\).</p>
    $$i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^t{V(t)dt}+i(0)$$
    $$i(t)=\frac{1}{0.1}\int_0^t{20te^{-10t}dt}$$
    $$i(t)=200\int_0^t{te^{-10t}dt}$$
    <p>This utilizes integration from calculus so make sure to review that to know how to solve this equation. We use
        integration by parts here. Let's set \(u=t\) and \(dv=e^{-10t}dt\).</p>
    $$du=dt$$
    $$v=\int{e^{-10t}dt}$$
    $$v=\frac{1}{-10}e^{-10t}$$
    $$uv-\int{vdu}$$
    $$t(\frac{1}{-10}e^{-10t})-\int{\frac{1}{-10}e^{-10t}du}$$
    $$\frac{t}{10}e^{-10t}\bigl|_0^t-\frac{1}{100}e^{-10t}\bigl|_0^t$$
    $$[(-\frac{t}{10}e^{-10t})-(0)]-[(\frac{1}{100}e^{-10t})-(\frac{1}{100})]$$
    <p>Finally, put the 200 back from the beginning:</p>
    $$i(t)=2-20te^{-10t}-2e^{-10t}$$
    <h4>Power and Energy in an Inductor</h4>
    <p>Let's review the difference between energy and power. Power is the flow of energy. If you pull a rubber band
        apart,
        you have stored energy in that system. The process of pulling it apart is applying power. Since \(P=iv\), it's
        pretty easy to see that \(P=Li\frac{di}{dt}\).</p>
    <p>Since we also know how to write i in terms of V for inductors:</p>
    $$P=V[\frac{1}{L}\int_0^t{V(t)dt}+i(0)]$$
    <p>So how much energy is stored in an inductor?</p>
    <p>Remember that power is the flow of energy, or the rate energy is added over time. So the total energy is the
        integral of power.</p>
    $$w=\int{pdt}$$
    $$w=\int{Li\frac{di}{dt}*dt}$$
    $$w=\int{Lidi}$$
    $$w=\frac{1}{2}Li^2$$
    <p>What you can infer from this is that the energy stored in an inductor depends on the current flowing through it.
        Which means, even if the current is not changing, there is a certain amount of current stored. This is in
        contrast
        to the power, or the voltage, which depends on the rate of change of the current.</p>
    <h4>Current through a capacitor</h4>
    <p>Capacitors store energy in an electric field, whereas inductors store energy in a magnetic field. You can think
        of
        capacitors as parallel plates. Imagine having two square sheets of metal placed right next to each other,
        parallel.
        In between exists a dielectric, aka an insulator, through which no current can flow. When you add a current
        (hole
        current meaning it's positive) to one plate, a positive charge builds up. This positive charge spreads
        throughout
        the plate and creates an electric field, causing negative charge to build up on the other plate. So while no
        electrons actually flow through the dielectric, from the outside, it looks like positive current is flowing into
        one
        plate and positive current is flowing out the other (because negative charge is flowing into it). This electric
        field between these two plates is what stores energy.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/capacitor.svg')}}" style="width: 40%">
    <p>The units of capacitance is the Farad, but 1 Farad is huge (you won't ever see a real capacitor with 1 Farad
        capacitance), so usually you'll be using things like microFarads. The current through a capacitor:</p>
    $$i=C\frac{dv}{dt}$$
    <p>You can see that this is fairly similar to the equation for voltage for the inductor. It's kind of like they
        swapped around. You can think of it such that the buildup of charge is what generates the electric field and the
        voltage drop across the capacitor. The only way for there to be an increase in that voltage difference (a
        positive
        dv/dt) is if more positive charge is going to the positive plate, which means there must be a positive current
        going
        to that plate.</p>
    <p>If you think about an inductor, if the current is constant and you've reached steady state, then the inductor
        pretty much acts as a short circuit or a piece of wire. For a capacitor, if you keep adding current and you've
        reached steady state, then eventually the plates are saturated, and no more current can pass through, thereby
        turning it into an open circuit.</p>
    <p>So let's see if we can figure out the voltage from the current.</p>
    $$i=C\frac{dv}{dt}$$
    $$\frac{i}{C}dt=dv$$
    $$v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int_0^t{i(t)dt}+v_0$$
    <p>This equation should make sense, since as your current builds up, the voltage across the capacitor builds up.</p>
    <p>So then the power in the capacitor is \(P=iv=Cv\frac{dv}{dt}\).</p>
    $$P=iv=i[\frac{1}{C}\int_0^t{i(t)dt}+v_0]$$
    <p>We can also get the energy in the capacitor. Since power is energy over time, \(P=\frac{dw}{dt}\).</p>
    $$P=Cv\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{dw}{dt}$$
    $$w=C*\frac{1}{2}v^2$$
    <p>So you see this all makes sense. For an inductor, the energy is stored in a magnetic field, which depends on the
        current. For a capacitor, the energy stored depends on the electric field, which depends on the voltage.</p>
    <h4>Parallel and series for inductors and capacitors</h4>
    <p>Inductances work pretty much exactly like resistors when it comes to how they behave in series or in parallel.
        Think about a bunch of inductors in series. It's basically a bunch of coils of wire next to each other. If you
        pretend the wire between them is super small, it's almost as if you just have one huge coil of wire. So it makes
        sense for the total inductance to just be the sum of the individuals. Capacitors are opposite of resistors (so,
        for
        capacitors in series, you have to add the inverses). If you think about a bunch of capacitors in parallel, it's
        almost as if you have just one giant parallel plate capacitor, so it makes sense to just add the capacitances up
        in
        that case.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/inductor_parallel.svg')}}" style="width:30%">
    <p>Alright. Let's do some calculations for an example problem. Let's say at the start of the circuit, \(i_1=-2\) and
        \(i_2=4\). And let's say voltage changes over time, such that \(v(t)=-40e^{-5t}\).</p>
    <p>The first question is: what is the equivalent inductance? Just like in resistors, all we have to do to find an
        equivalent inductance in parallel is product over sum: \(L_\text{eq}=\frac{5*20}{5+25}=4\).</p>
    <p>The next question: what is the initial current through the equivalent inductor? For this, all we have to do is
        add
        the two currents up: \(-2+4=2\). So the current when \(t=0\) is 2 amps.</p>
    <p>Okay, so now let's find the current at a time other than at 0. Note that we are given the function for the
        voltage.
        We know that for an inductor, \(v=L\frac{di}{dt}\). The voltage at any timepoint is how fast the current is
        changing
        at that timepoint. So if you want to find the total current passing at a certain time, you have to integrate the
        voltage from time 0 to time t (adding up an infinite amount of infinitely small chunks of current). Basically,
        you're finding the area under the function of voltage from 0 to t.</p>
    $$di=\frac{1}{L}vdt$$
    $$i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int_0^t{v(t)dt}+i(0)$$
    <p>We know the initial current (2), the function for v, and the equivalent inductance L (4).</p>
    $$i(t)=\frac{1}{4}\int_0^t{-40e^{-5t}dt}+2$$
    $$i(t)=-10\int_0^t{e^{-5t}dt}+2$$
    $$i(t)=-10*\frac{1}{-5}e^{-5t}\rvert_0^t+2$$
    $$i(t)=2[e^{-5t}-e^0]+2$$
    $$i(t)=2e^{-5t}$$
    <h4>Step and Natural Response</h4>
    <p>There is transient state and steady state of a circuit. The transient state is when the circuit is changing
        through
        the first fraction of time. The steady state is what happens after things have stopped changing, maybe a second
        or a
        minute after the circuit has started. The natural response of a circuit is what happens when the circuit
        discharges
        in the absence of any power sources. The step response is what happens when we initially hook up some power
        source
        and send some current to our circuit, aka the charging process.</p>
    <h4>Natural Response of an RL Circuit</h4>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/RL_natural.svg')}}">
    <p>An RL circuit is a circuit with resistors and inductors. Let's take a look at the circuit above. On the left, you
        have a Norton equivalent circuit with a current source and its resistance. That source will provide us with our
        initial steady state parameters. On the right side of the circuit you see a simple inductor and resistor in
        parallel. At the top, you see a switch, which is closed at t=0 but which opens once we start the timer. So what
        this
        means is that when t is less than 0 (before we flip the switch), current is running through the circuit.
        Remember
        when current goes through an inductor, it stores energy in a magnetic field. But with a constant current, there
        is
        no voltage drop across the inductor, and it acts simply as a short circuit. So at a time before 0, all the
        current
        goes through the inductor. Now, after you flip the switch, the right side (RL circuit) becomes disconnected from
        the
        left side (power source). So then the energy stored as a magnetic field in the inductor will convert into
        current
        and dissipate (natural response).</p>
    <p>So let's do KVL on the RL circuit.</p>
    $$L\frac{di}{dt}+iR=0$$
    $$L\frac{di}{dt}=-iR$$
    $$\frac{1}{i}di=-\frac{R}{L}dt$$
    $$\int_{i(0)}^{i(t)}\frac{1}{i}di=-\int_0^t\frac{R}{L}dt$$
    $$\ln{i(t)}-\ln{i(0)}=-\frac{Rt}{L}$$
    $$\ln{\frac{i(t)}{i(0)}}=-\frac{Rt}{L}$$
    $$e^{\ln{\frac{i(t)}{i(0)}}}=e^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}$$
    $$\frac{i(t)}{i(0)}=e^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}$$
    $$i(t)=i(0)e^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}$$
    <p>This result is the exponential decay, or the natural response, or a RL circuit. You can see that the rate of
        decay
        depends on R and L. The higher the resistance in the circuit, the faster the current goes to 0. The higher the
        inductance, the longer it takes for the current to get to 0 (which makes sense conceptually).</p>
    <p>The value \(\tau=L/R\) such that \(i(t)=i(0)e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\). Which means that at \(1\tau\) seconds, the
        current is \(i(0)/e=0.37I_0\) (we rewrite the initial current with a capital letter for consistency sake). By
        the
        time you reach 5 time constants, the value of the current is \(0.007I_0\), which means the current has gone to
        less
        than 1% of its initial state. We can define this with fuzzy logic as "a long time." So the purpose of having a
        time
        constant is just having that "rule of thumb" that 5 time constants is "long enough time" for the transient state
        to
        end.</p>
    <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/RL_problem1.svg')}}">
    <p>Let's put some of these to an example. The first question for the above circuit is to find \(i_L(t)\). When t is
        0,
        the switch is flipped open, thereby cutting off the current source from the left. Then, at that point, the
        energy
        stored in the inductor will drive a current through the resistors until there is no more energy. The 10ohm and
        40ohm
        resistors are in parallel, and so we can simplify that into a 8 ohm resistor. And the 2 ohm resistor will be in
        series with the 8 ohm resistor, making the equivalent resistance of the right side a total of 10 ohms. So then
        we
        use KVL and integrate again to find:</p>
    $$i_L(t)=I_0e^{-5t}$$
    <p>Recognize that the initial current \(I_0\) is simply 20 amps, because when the circuit is closed, all of the
        current is traveling through the inductor (because every other path has resistance!).</p>
    $$i_L(t)=20e^{-5t}$$
    <p>Next part of the question is to find \(i_1(t)\). Since the current splits between the 10 and 40 ohm resistors,
        this
        is a current divider, so the resulting current through the 40 ohm resistor is just
        \(-20e^{-5t}*(10/50)=-4e^{-5t}\).
        Note we add a negative sign since that current is backwards from the one drawn in the figure.</p>
    <p>Next part is to find \(v_1(t)\). Again, pretty straight forward. Ohm's law. \(-160e^{-5t}\).</p>
    <p>The last part is to find the % of total energy stored in 2 H inductor that is dissipated in the 10 ohm resistor.
        The total energy stored in the inductor is \(w=\frac{1}{2}Li^2\), which we derived previously by setting
        \(P=i*L\frac{di}{dt}\) and integrating both sides. So the energy stored in the inductor of this question is
        \(1/2*2*20^2=400\) Joules. Then, for the energy dissipated by the resistor, we can integrate power again just
        for
        that resistor. We know that the voltage across the 10 ohm resistor is the same as that for the 40 ohm resistor.
        So
        we can use:</p>
    $$P=V^2/R$$
    $$P=(-160e^{-5t})^2/10=2560e^{-10t}$$
    <p>Then, we integrate with respect to time.</p>
    $$\int_0^\infty{Pdt}=w=2560\int_0^\infty{e^{-10t}dt}$$
    <p>Again, we integrate by parts. Say we set \(u(t)=-10t\). Then the equation becomes \(e^u\). Integral of an
        exponential is just the exponential. But we have to divide by derivative of u due to chain rule. So the
        indefinite
        integral is \(-\frac{1}{10}e^{-10t}\). And so the definite integral from 0 to infinity would be
        \(-\frac{1}{10}[e^{-\infty}-e^0]=-\frac{1}{10}\). And don't forget the 2560 in front, so the total energy
        dissipated
        by the 10 ohm resistor is -256 watts. Finally, \(256/400=64%\). So the total energy dissipated by the 10 ohm
        resistor is 64%. Pretty cool, right?</p>
    <h4>Natural Response of a RC Circuit</h4>
    <p>So we can do this same natural response, transient to steady state thing with capacitors, keeping in mind that
        capacitors store energy in an electric field rather than a magnetic field. So whereas we used KVL for the RL
        circuit, let's use KCL for the RC circuit. Except in this case, we can imagine the node being just between a
        capacitor and a resistor. Basically, the current going through the capacitor has to be equal to the current
        going
        through the resistor. In addition, the voltage drop across the capacitor has to be equal to the voltage drop
        across
        the resistor.</p>
    $$C\frac{dV}{dt}=-\frac{V}{R}$$
    $$\frac{1}{V}dV=-\frac{1}{RC}dt$$
    $$\int_{V(0)}^{V(t)}{\frac{1}{V}dV}=-\int_0^t{\frac{1}{RC}dt}$$
    $$\ln{V(t)}-\ln{V(0)}=-\frac{t}{RC}$$
    $$e^{\ln{\frac{V(t)}{V(0)}}}=e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}$$
    $$V(t)=V_0e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}$$
    <p>The time constant for RC circuits is RC, so that, again, by 5 time constants, the voltage becomes <1% and
            negligible.</p> <img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/electronics/capacitor_problem.svg')}}">
            <p>Alright, let's do a natural response problem for an RC circuit. Our first question is what is the voltage
                across the capacitor as soon as the switch opens? So v(0). If you think about it, when the switch is
                closed, the
                capacitor has enough time to completely saturate its plate with charge. So voltage should be maximum at
                t=0. It
                also means that no more current is going into the capacitor. Which means all the current is going
                through the
                20k ohm resistor. The 20k ohm resistor is in series with the 10k ohm resistor, so the total resistance
                is 30k on
                that leg. So there is a current divider for the 15 mA current between a 60k ohm resistor and a 30k ohm
                resistor.
                The current going through the 30k ohm resistor is 15 mA * (60k/(30k+60k)), which is the equation using a
                current
                divider (resistance of the other leg over the sum of both legs). \(0.015*(2/3)=0.01\). So the current
                going
                through the 20k ohm resistor is 0.01 A. From there, Ohm's law, we can calculate the voltage drop across
                the 20k
                ohm resistor. \(20000*0.01=200\). The voltage drop across the capacitor is the same as across the
                resistor since
                they're parallel. So \(V(0)=200\) volts.</p>
            <p>Second part is to find the time constant of the RC circuit. Pretty easy. Remember it's just
                \(\tau=RC=20\times10^3*0.5\times10^{-6}=1\times10^{-2}\).</p>
            <p>Next, we want to find \(v(t)\) after we flip the switch open. So we just derived this equation from using
                KCL
                and integrating, so it's just \(V(t)=200e^{-\frac{t}{0.01}}=200e^{-100t}\).</p>
            <p>Next, we want to find the initial energy stored in the capacitor. We previously derived this by
                integrating
                power over time. So \(w=C*\frac{1}{2}*200^2=20000*0.5\times10^{-6}=0.01\) joules.</p>
            <p>Finally, let's calculate how long it takes to dissipate 75% of the initially stored energy. We know total
                energy stored by the capacitor, so 75% of that is 0.01*0.75=0.0075. How do you find energy dissipated by
                the
                resistor? Have to integrate power over time.</p>
            $$\int_0^x{Pdt}=0.0075$$
            $$\int_0^x{\frac{V^2}{R}dt}=0.0075$$
            $$\int_0^x{\frac{40000e^{-200t}}{20000}dt}=0.0075$$
            $$\int_0^x{2e^{-200t}dt}=0.0075$$
            $$-\frac{1}{100}[e^{-200x}-e^{0}]=0.0075$$
            $$e^{-200x}=0.25$$
            $$-200x=\ln{0.25}$$
            $$x=0.00693$$
            <p>So it takes less than 1 millisecond to dissipate 75% of the stored energy in this capacitor.</p>
            <h4>Step Response of RL Circuits</h4>
            <p>The step response is the opposite of the natural response. It's what charges the inductor/capacitor.
                Deriving
                the step response is similar to the natural response, so we will go straight to the equations (write KVL
                equations and solve differential equations). For an RL circuit:</p>
            $$i(t)=\frac{V_s}{R}+(I_0-\frac{V_2}{R})e^{-t/\tau}$$
            <p>And, if the initial current is 0, which is what it usually is:</p>
            $$i(t)=\frac{V_s}{R}-\frac{V_2}{R}e^{-t/\tau}$$
            <p>You can see that at time 0, the current is 0, and at time infinity, the current is equal to V/R, as if
                the
                inductor isn't even there.</p>
            <p>Recall that \(V=L\frac{di}{dt}\) for inductors.</p>
            $$V(t)=L[0+(I_0-\frac{V_s}{R})e^{\frac{-Rt}{L}}(-\frac{R}{L})]$$
            $$V(t)=(V_s-RI_0)e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}$$
            <p>Which means, if the initial current is 0:</p>
            $$V(t)=V_se^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}$$
