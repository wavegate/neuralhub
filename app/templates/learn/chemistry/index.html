<h4>Covalent</h4>
<p>HCl is a covalent compound because the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and chloride is less than 2.0.
</p>
<div class="first">Solids and liquids</div><a class="anchor" id="liquids_solids"></a>
<p>Particles in a solid are tightly packed together and often arranged in a regular pattern; in a liquid, they are close
    together with no regular arrangement; in a gas, they are far apart with no regular arrangement. Particles in a solid
    vibrate about fixed positions and do not generally move in relation to one another; in a liquid, they move past each
    other but remain in essentially constant contact; in a gas, they move independent of one another except when they
    collide.</p>
<p>The phase in which a substance exists depends on its intermolecular forces and the kinetic energies of its molecules.
    Intermolecular forces hold the atoms and molecules together, whereas kinetic energy overcomes these attractive
    forces. Gases can be liquefied by increasing the pressure, which brnigs the molecules of a gas closer together, such
    that the intermolecular forces become stronger.</p>
<p>All of the attractive forces between neutral atoms and molecules are known as van der Waals forces.</p>
<h4>Dispersion forces</h4>
<p>One of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or
    molecules composing the substance, called the London dispersion force, or simply dispersion force. An atom or
    molecule can develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if the electrons are distributed asymmetrically, distorting
    the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. This results in a relatively weak
    electrostatic attraction between the species. These forces are relatively weak and become significant only when the
    molecules are very close. Larger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit stronger dispersion forces.</p>
<p>The shapes of molecules also affect the magnitudes of the dispersion forces between them. Longer shapes provide a
    greater surface area available for contact between molecules, resulting in correspondingly stronger dispersion
    forces. More compact shapes have weaker dispersion forces.</p>
<h4>Dipole-dipole attractions</h4>
<p>The positive end of one polar molecule can attract the negative end of another polar molecule, called a dipole-dipole
    attraction. As an example, HCl has a much higher normal boiling point (188 K) compared to F2 (85 K), since HCl can
    form dipole-dipole interactions whereas F2 cannot. Boiling and freezing points, or enthalpies of vaporization or
    fusion, can be used as indicators of relative strengths of intermolecular forces of attractio npresent within
    different substances.</p>
<h4>Hydrogen bonding</h4>
<p>A particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction, called a hydrogen bond, occurs when a molecule contains a hydrogen
    atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most electronegative elements). The very large
    difference in electronegativity between the H atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5
    for an O atom, or 3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively small sizes of
    F, O, and N, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these atoms. Hydrogen bonding is generally much
    stronger than dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces.</p>
<h4>Viscosity</h4>
<p>The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow, determined by the intermolecular forces between the
    molecules of the liquid, the size and shape of the molecules, and the temperature. The more structurally complex the
    molecules are and the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the more difficult it is for them to move past each
    other and the greater the viscosity of the liquid. As the temperature increases, the molecules move more rapidly and
    thus the viscosity of the liquid decreases.</p>
<h4>Cohesive forces</h4>
<p>The various intermolecular forces between identical molecules of a substance are examples of cohesive forces. The
    molecules within the liquid are surrounded by other molecules and are attracted equally in all directions. However,
    the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by about one-half as many molecules. Because of this
    unbalance, liquids contract to form a shape that minimizes the number of molecules on the surface, minimizing
    surface area, causing a small drop of liquid to assume a spherical shape. Surface tension is defined as the energy
    required to increase the surface area of a liquid, or the force required to increase the length of a liquid surface
    by a given amount. This property results from cohesive forces between molecules at the surface, causing the surface
    of a liquid to behave like a stretched rubber membrane. Among common liquids, water exhibits a distinctly high
    surface tension due to strong hydrogen bonding, giving it a relatively "tough skin" allowing things like a steel
    needle or some insects to be able to move on the surface on water even though they are more dense than water.</p>
<h4>Adhesive forces</h4>
<p>The intermolecular forces between two different molecules are called adhesive forces. Water does not wet waxed
    surfaces or many plastics because the cohesive forces within the drops are greater than the adhesive forces between
    the water and the plastic. When water is confined in a glass tube, its meniscus (surface) has a concave shape
    because water wets the glass and creeps up the side of the tube. On the other hand, the adhesive force between
    mercury and glass is relatively lower than the cohesive forces between mercury atoms, and so mercury forms a convex
    meniscus when confined in a tube.</p>
<h4>Capillary action</h4>
<p>When a liquid flows within a porous material due to the attraction of the liquid molecules to the surface of the
    material and to other liquid molecules, this is an example of capillary action, where adhesive forces between the
    liquid and the porous material, combined with the cohesive forces within the liquid, is strong enough to move the
    liquid upward against gravity. The height to which a liquid will rise in a capillary tube is determined
    by:\[h=\frac{2T\cos \theta}{r\rho g}\]where \(h\) is the height of the liquid inside the capillary tube relative to
    the surface of the liquid outside the tube, \(T\) is the surface tension of the liquid, \(\theta\) is the contact
    angle between the liquid and the tube, \(r\) is the radius of the tube, \(\rho\) is the density of the liquid, and
    \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity.</p>
<h4>Vapor pressure</h4>
<p>The change from the gas phase to the liquid is called condensation. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to
    the rate of vaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the container changes. The
    vapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static
    situation, but a dynamic equilibrium, in which reciprocal processes occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted by
    the vapor in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the liquid's vapor
    pressure or equilibrium vapor pressure. The area of the surface of the liquid in contact with a vapor and the size
    of the vessel have no effect on the vapor pressure, but they do affect the time required for the equilibrium to be
    reached. Strong intermolecular forces will favor "recapture" of gas-phase molecules resulting in relatively low
    vapor pressure (larger molecules, polar molecules, hydrogen bonding, etc.).</p>
<p>As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases due to increased average kinetic energy of the molecules. At
    a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid.</p>
<h4>Boiling point</h4>
<p>When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling
    point, the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by its
    gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open containers, this pressure is that due to the earth's atmosphere. The
    normal boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding pressure is equal to 1 atm or
    101.3 kPa.</p>
<h4>Clausius-Clapeyron equation</h4>
<p>The relationship between a substance's vapor pressure and its temperature is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron
    equation:\[P=Ae^{-\Delta H_\text{vap}/RT}\]where \(\Delta H_\text{vap}\) is the enthalpy of vaporization for the
    liquid, \(R\) is the gas constant, \(A\) is a constant whose value depends on the chemical identity of the
    substance, \(T\) is temperature in Kelvin. The equation can be rearranged to compare the vapor pressure of a
    substance at different
    temperatures:\[\ln(\frac{P_2}{P_1})=\frac{\Delta H_\text{vap}}{R}(\frac{1}{T_1}-\frac{1}{T_2})\]</p>
<h4>Enthalpy of vaporization</h4>
<p>Vaporization is an endothermic process. When water on your skin evaporates, it removes heat from your skin and causes
    you to feel cold. Therefore, the condensation of a gas releases heat.</p>
<h4>Melting and freezing</h4>
<p>When we heat a crystalline solid, we increase the average energy of its atoms, molecules, or ions and the solid gets
    hotter. At some point, the added energy allows the particles to break apart and transition into a liquid state,
    melting the solid. At this point, the temperature stops rising despite the continual input of heat and remains
    constant until al lthe solid is melted. Only after all of the solid has melted will continued heating increase the
    temperature of the liquid. The temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of a given substance are in
    equilibrium is called the melting point of the solid or the freezing point of the liquid.</p>
<p>The amount of heat required to change one mole of a substance from the solid state to the liquid state is the
    enthalopy of fusion \(\Delta H_\text{fus}\) of the substance. Fusion is an endothermic process. Freezing, the
    reciprocal process, is an exothermic process.</p>
<h4>Sublimation and deposition</h4>
<p>Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid state, via sublimation. The reverse
    of sublimation is deposition. The formation of frost is an example of deposition; dry ice disappearing without ever
    turning into a liquid is sublimation. The enthalpy of sublimation \(\Delta H_\text{sub}\) is the energy required to
    convert one mole of a substance form the solid to the gaseous state.</p>
<p>Sublimation can be modeled as a sequential two-step process of melting followed by vaporization. Applying Hess's law,
    we can estimate the enthalpy of sublimation by the sum of its enthalpies of fusion and vaporization:\[\Delta
    H_\text{sub}=\Delta H_\text{fus} + \Delta H_\text{vap}\]</p>
<h4>Heating and cooling curves</h4>
<p>The relation between amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance and its accompanying temperature change
    is:\[q=mc\Delta T\]where \(q\) is the amount of heat, \(m\) is the mass of the substance and \(c\) is its specific
    heat. This relation applies to matter being heated or cooled but not undergoing a change in state. While a substance
    is undergoing a change in state, its temperature remains constant. In order to find the total heat needed to convert
    a substance from one temperature to another through a phase change, you must add the heat absorbed/released due to
    the temperature change as well as the heat of phase change.</p>
<p>For example, to convert ice into steam, you have the equation:\[q_\text{total}=(mc\Delta T)_\text{ice}+n\Delta
    H_\text{fus} + (mc\Delta T)_\text{water} + n\Delta H_\text{vap}+(mc\Delta T)_\text{steam}\]Noting that the specific
    heat for ice, water, and steam are all different.</p>
<h4>Phase diagrams</h4>
<p>A phase diagram combines plots of pressure versus temperature for the liquid-gas, solid-liquid, and solid-gas
    phase-transition equilibria of a substance.</p>
<img src="https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220422.171947/resources/1c66c36d9701ebf3106287ea61723d470c6cce5e"

    alt="phase diagram water">
<p>Notice that the slope for the fusion curve is negative for water whereas the slope for the fusion curve is positive
    for most other substances. For most substances, if you increase the pressure, you turn liquid into solid as the
    molecules in the solid are usually closer together. However, the hydrogen bonds in water encourage solid water to be
    less dense and father apart forming a lattice, so increasing
    pressure actually forces solid water to become liquid.</p>
<p>The triple point is the point at which all three phases of the substance exist in equilibrium.</p>
<img src="https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220422.171947/resources/5df63699dd7bdb7aa920a1415ba26f5f30a97a70"
    alt="phase diagram co2">
<p>Note that carbon dioxide at atmospheric pressure sublimes when temperature is increased.</p>
<h4>Supercritical fluids</h4>
<p>The critical point is the point where any higher temperature or pressure will cause the substance to become a
    supercritical fluid, where a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. At this point, the
    boundary between liquid and vapor phases disappears and all of the water is now present in a single phase whose
    physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. Like a gas, a supercritical
    fluid will expand and fill a container, but its density is much greater than typical gas densities, typically being
    cloes to that of liquids. They can dissolve nonvolatile soluts, exhibit no surface tension and have very low
    viscoties, so they can penetrate very small openings in a solid mixture and remove soluble components, making them
    very useful solvents for a variety of applications.</p>
<h4>Solid state of matter</h4>
<p>When most liquids are cooled, they eventually freeze and form crystalline solids, in which the molecules are arranged
    in a definite repeating pattern. If a liquid freezes before its molecules become arranged in an orderly pattern,
    then it can result in an amorphous or noncrystalline solid (or sometimes a glass). Metals and ionic compounds
    typically form ordered, crystalline solids, whereas substances that consist of large molecules or a mixture of
    molecules whose movements are more restricted often form amorphous solids. Some substances such as silicon dioxide
    can form either crystalline or amorphous solids.</p>
<h4>Ionic solids</h4>
<p>Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive and negative ions held together by
    electrostatic attractions, which are quite strong. Therefore, they have high melting points. Although they are hard,
    they are brittle and tend to shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity but will conduct if
    dissolved. Most compounds formed by a metallic element and a nonmetallic element are ionic.</p>
<h4>Metallic solids</h4>
<p>Metallic solids, such as copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by metal atoms, often described as a uniform
    distribution of atomic nuclei within a "sea" of delocalized electrons. The atoms are held together by metallic
    bonding. Metallic solids exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic luster, and malleability. Many
    are very hard and are quite strong. They do not shatter and therefore make useful construction materials. The
    melting points of the metals vary widely.</p>
<h4>Covalent network solid</h4>
<p>Covalent network solids, such as diamond, silicon, silicon dioxide (sand), and silicon carbide (carborundum, the
    abrasive on sandpaper), have networks of covalent bonds. To break the network, covalent bonds must be broken.
    Therefore, these solids are hard, strong, and have high melting points. Diamond is one of the hardest substances
    known.</p>
<h4>Molecular solids</h4>
<p>Molecular solids, such as ice, sucrose (table sugar), and iodine, are composed of neutral molecules, and the strength
    and melting points of these crystals vary widely.</p>
<h4>Properties of solids</h4>
<p>A crystalline solid has a precise melting temperature because each atom or molecule of the same type is held in place
    with the same forces or energy. Ionic crystalline solids are hard, brittle, conduct electricity as a liquid but not
    as a solid, and have high to very high melting points. Metallic solids are shiny, malleable, ductile, conducts heat
    and electricity well, and has variable hardness and melting temperature. Covalent network solids are very hard, not
    conductive, and have very high melting points. Molecular solids have variable hardness, variable brittleness, are
    not conductive, and have low melting points.</p>
<h4>Crystal defects</h4>
<p>Occasional defects may occur in the repeating pattern of crystalline solids. Vacancies are defects that occur when
    positions that should contain atoms or ions are vacant. Less commonly, other atoms occupy these positions, called
    interstitial sites. Trace amounts of impurities are sometimes added to a crystal (a process called doping) to create
    defects in the structure that yield desirable changes in its properties. For example, silicon crystals are doped
    with varying amounts of elements to yield electrical properties for their use in the manufacture of semiconductors
    and computer chips.</p>
<h4>Structures of metals</h4>
<p>A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely together in a repating pattern. The structure of
    a crystalline solid, whether a metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is
    referred to as its unit cell, which consists of lattice points that represent the locations of atoms or ions. The
    entire structure then consists of this unit cell repeating in three dimensions.</p>
<h4>Simple cubic structure</h4>
<p>When metal atoms are arranged with spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the lattice
    structure is called simple cubic, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive cubic unit
    cell.</p>
<p>In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not packed as closely as they could be, and they only "fill" about 52%
    of the volume of the container. This is relatively inefficient, and only one metal, polonium, crystallizes in a
    simple cubic structure. The number of particles that each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its
    coordination number. For a polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is six.</p>
<img src="https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220422.171947/resources/94dd175c49569c36358ed1d36ca7035ad9f78970"
    alt="simple cubic lattice">
<p>Atoms at adjacent corners of the unit cell contact each other, so the edge length of the simple cubic cell is equal
    to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. Since 1/8 of an atom is in each cube, and each cube has 8 of these
    chunks, there is 1 atom within one simple cubic unit cell. From this reasoning, you can find the edge length and
    density of polonium's crystal from its atomic radius.</p>
<h4>Body centered cubic</h4>
<p>Metals that crystallize in an arrangement in which there are atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the center is
    called a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid. Atoms in the corner do not contact each other but do contact the atom in
    the center. Each unit cell contains 2 atoms, and an atom in a BCC structure has a coordination number of eight (the
    corner atoms touch 8 center atoms but do not touch other corner atoms).</p>
<p>Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently packed, occupying 68% of total volume. Elements or compounds that
    crystallize with the same structure are said to be isomorphous, and K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe are isomorphous with
    BCC structure.</p>
<h4>Face centered cubic</h4>
<p>Face-centered cubic (FCC) solids) have atoms at each corner and an atom at the center of each face. Each unit cell
    contains four atoms (1/8 at each of 8 corners and 1/2 at each of 6 faces). Atoms in FCC arrangement are packed as
    closely together as possible, occupying 74% of the volume, making the structure also being called cubic closest
    packing (CCP).</p>
<img src="https://neuralhuborg.s3.amazonaws.com/img/fcc.png" alt="fcc">
<p>Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer above, giving a
    coordination number of 12.</p>
<p>Because closer packing maximizes the overall atractions between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy,
    the atoms in most metals pack in this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline
    structures: CPP, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP). Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged
    atoms.</p>
<h4>Lattice systems</h4>
<p>In general, a unit cell is defined by the lengths of three axes and the angles between them. There are seven
    different lattice systems, some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of fourteen different unit
    cells.</p>
<img src="https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220422.171947/resources/ffee2d092da3929388b7087a5a0226af2ab7b940"
    alt="unit cell shapes">
<h4>Structures of ionic crystals</h4>
<p>Ionic crystals usually have atoms of different sizes, and so the crystal structure is more complex. Stable structures
    for ionic compounds result when ions of one charge are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge
    and when cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two principal factors: the
    relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of positive and negative ions in the compound.</p>
<p>In simple ionic structures, we find the anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a
    closest-packed array. The smaller cations commonly occupy one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining
    between the anions. The four anions surrounding a hole is arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so the hole is
    called a tetrahedral hole. The larger type of hole is found at the center of six anions and is called an octahedral
    hole. The ratio of octahedral holes to anions in either an HCP or CCP structure is 1:1.</p>
<h4>Unit cells of ionic compounds</h4>
<p>When an ionic compound is composed of cations and anions of similar size in 1:1 ratio, it typically forms a simple
    cubic structure. This is like BCC with an atom in the center except the center atom is the cation/anion. When an
    ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically
    crystallizes with an FCC unit cell. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example of this. We can think of sodium and
    chloride making the atoms at the vertex of each cube, which makes the larger cube "face-centered."</p>
<img src="https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220422.171947/resources/74788c399c0c30d5f1013019dbff65a6dbee3ffa"
    alt="NaCl face centered">
<h4>Calculation of ionic radii</h4>
<p>If we know the edge length of a unit cell of an ionic compound and the position of the ions in the cell, we can
    calculate ionic radii for the ions in the compound if we make assumptions about individual ionic shapes and
    contacts.</p>
<h4>X-ray crystallography</h4>
<p>The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined form measurements of the
    diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of
    travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are comparable
    to those of the wavelength of the light. When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are
    scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction
    encounter one another, they undergo interference, changing the intensity depending upon the extent to which the
    combining waves' maxima are separated. When x-rays of a certain wavelength are scattered by atoms in adjacent
    crystal planes separated by a distance, they may undergo constructive interference, according to the Bragg
    equation:\[n\lambda=2d\sin \theta\]</p>
<p>An x-ray diffractometer may be used to measure the angles at which x-rays are diffracted when interacting with a
    crystal, allowing us to compute distances between atoms.</p>

<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>Solutions are defined as homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances. One component is often present at
    significantly greater concentration, called the solvent. The other components in relatively lesser concentrations
    are called solutes. The subscript "aq" in a chemical equation signifies that the molecules are solutes and are
    therefore individually dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water). Gravity does not cause these dispersed
    solutes to
    "settle out" over time.</p>
<p>Water is frequently thought of as the solvent (and is often called the universal solvent because it is capable of
    dissolving so many different substances). However,, almost any gas, liquid, or solid can act as a solvent. Many
    alloys are solid sollutions of one metal dissolved in another. Air is a gaseous solution, and you can dissolve
    oxygen (a gas), alcohol (a liquid), and sugar (a solid) all in water to form a liquid solution.</p>
<p>Solutions are 1) homogeneous, 2) has the physical state of the solvent, 3) have components of a solution dispersed on
    a molecular scale, 4) will not settle or separate out, and 5) can have varying composition continuously within
    limits determined by the solubility of the components.</p>
<h4>Formation of solutions</h4>
<p>Formation of a solution is a spontaneous process, meaning it occurs without requirement of energy from an external
    source. You can stir a mixture to speed up the dissolution process, but it will dissolve eventually no matter what.
    Two criteria that favor the spontaneous formation of a solution is a decrease in the internal energy of the system
    (exothermic change) and an increased dispersal of matter in the system (increasing entropy).</p>
<h4>Ideal solutions</h4>
<p>When the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species are no different
    than those present in separated components, the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change, and such a
    solution is called an ideal solution. An example is a mixture of ideal gases, since the entities comprising these
    gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions.</p>
<h4>Solvation</h4>
<p>Three types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process: solute-solute,
    solvent-solvent, and solute-solvent. First, energy must be consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent
    attractions (endothermic), and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (exothermic process called
    solvation). The actual spontaneity follows principles of thermodynamics, so a dissolution can be endothermic and
    still be spontaneous. An example is an instant cold pack, which dissolves \(\ce{NH4NO3}\) with water, causing an
    endothermic dissolution and absorbing heat from surroundings.</p>
<h4>Electrolytes</h4>
<p>Substances dissolved in water that turn into ions make up an important class of compounds called electrolytes.
    Substances that do not
    yield ions when dissolved are called nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical change that generates ions is 100%
    efficient, then the substance is a strong electrolyte (otherwise it is a weak electrolyte). The strength of the
    electrolyte can be determined by its ability to conduct electricity.</p>
<h4>Ionic electrolytes</h4>
<p>The electrostatic attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole attraction. When
    ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and disperse uniformly throughout the solution
    because water molecules surround and solvate the ions, reducing the electrostatic forces between them, representing
    a physical change known as dissociation. The property of it being a strong electrolyte is independent of how much
    you dissolve.</p>
<h4>Covalent electrolytes</h4>
<p>Some covalent compounds such as HCl can be an electrolyte and conduct electricity.</p>
<h4>Solubility</h4>
<p>The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may be achieved under given
    conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium. When a solute's concentration is equal to its solubility,
    it is said to be saturated with that solute. If it's less, then it's unsaturated. If it exceeds the solubility, it
    is supersaturated (eg. carbonated beverages right after being open). A solution that contains a relatively low
    concentration of solute is dilute; one with high concentration is concentrated.</p>
<h4>Solutions of gases in liquids</h4>
<p>For dissolving gases in liquids, there are no solute-solute interactions, so solute-solvent interactions are the sole
    energetic factor affecting solubility. Water solubility of oxygen is approximately three times greater than that of
    helium (greater dispersion forces) but 100 times less than chloromethane (dipole-dipole interactions). Higher
    temperature typically decreases gas solubility (think of it as the gas molecules having more energy to escape),
    which has large consequences for water ecosystems when higher water
    temperatures reduce levels of dissolved oxygens. Gas solubility increases as the pressure of theg as increases. For
    many gaseous solutes, the relation between solubility \(C_g\) and partial pressure \(P_g\) is:\[C-g=kP_g\]where k is
    a proportionality constant and depends on the identities of the gaseous solute and solvent. This is a mathematical
    statement of Henry's law: the quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in a definite volume of liquid is directly
    proportional to the pressure of the gas.</p>
<p>An example where this is relevant is decompression sickness or "the bends," when the gases dissolved in blood start
    to escape from the liquid causing bubbles that can cause a variety of symptoms as the diver ascends from high
    pressure to relatively low pressure.</p>
<h4>Solutions of liquids in liquids</h4>
<p>Liquids that can be mixed in any proportions to yield solutions have infinite mutual solubility and are said to be
    miscible. These are typically those with very similar polarities. Liquids that are only slightly soluble are
    immiscible, and liquids that have moderate mutual solubility are said to be partially miscible.</p>
<h4>Solutions of solids in liquids</h4>
<p>Solids are generally more soluble with increasing temperature, though there are exceptions. This can be used to
    prepare supersaturated solutions. For example, a solution can be saturated at a higher temperature, and then
    temperature can be decreased creating a supersaturated solution. Then precipitation of the excess solute can be
    initiated by adding a seed crystal or by mechanically agitating the solution, producing heat, such as in hand
    warmers.</p>
<h4>Colligative properties</h4>
<p>Some solution properties depend only upon the total concentration of solute species, regardless of their identities.
    These are colligative properties, and include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point
    depression, and osmotic pressure.</p>
<h4>Mole fraction and molality</h4>
<p>Molarity (M) is moles of solute over liters of solution. Molarity doesn't work too well when changing temperatures
    causes changes in the volume of the solution. So a better way to do calculations involving colligative properties is
    mole fraction, which is ratio of molar amount of something to the total number of moles in solution, and molality,
    which is moles of solute in kilograms of solvent. These amounts do not vary with temperature and are thus better
    suited for temperature-independent concentrations.</p>
<h4>Vapor pressure lowering</h4>
<p>Dissolving a nonvolatile substance in a volatile liquid results in lowering of the liquid's vapor pressure. The
    presence of solute decreases surface area available to solvent molecules and thereby reduces rate of solvent
    vaporization. A more rigorous explanation takes into account entropy (dissolving something in liquid increases the
    microstates available for that liquid to exist, which increases probability of existing in liquid state versus
    gaseous or solid state). A lower vapor pressures results with a
    correspondingly higher boiling point.</p>
<h4>Raoult's law</h4>
<p>The relationship between vapor pressures of solution components and the concentrations of those components is
    described by Raoult's law: the partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to the vapor
    pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution:\[P_A=X_AP_A^*\]where \(P_A\) is the
    partial pressure exerted by component A in the solution, \(P_A^*\) is the vapor pressure of pure A, and \(X_A\) is
    the mole fraction of A in the solution.</p>
<p>Recalling that the total pressure of a gaseous mixture is equal to the sum of partial pressures for all its
    components (Dalton's law of partial pressures), the total vapor pressure of a solution
    is:\[P_\text{solution}=\sum_i P_i=\sum_i X_i P_i^8\]</p>
<p>A nonvolatile substance is one whose vapor pressure is neglibible, and so the vapor pressure above a solution
    containing only nonolatile solutes is due only to the solvent.</p>
<h4>Distillation of solutions</h4>
<p>Solutions whose components have significantly different vapor pressures can be separated by a selective vaporization
    process known as distillation, by heating a solution at different temperatures to vaporize and separate the
    components. Oil refiners use large-scale fractional distillation to separate the components of crude oil. Crude oil
    is heated to high temperatures at the base of a tall fractionating column. Vaporized components reach adequately
    cool zones during their ascent, condense, and are collected.</p>
<img src="https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20220509.174553/resources/c1085f392660dd6b196706d13819c5d465b2ad39"
    alt="crude oil fractional distillation">
<h4>Boiling point elevation</h4>
<p>We discussed that vapor pressure is lowered, and so boiling point is subsequently increased, since boiling point is
    the temperature at which vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. This increase in boiling point is called
    boiling point elevation and is directly proportional to molal concentration:\[\Delta T_b=K_b m\]where \(K_b\) is the
    boiling point elevation constant or the ebullioscopic constant, which is dependent on the identity of the SOLVENT,
    and \(m\) is the molality of all solute species. The identity of the SOLUTE does not matter.</p>
<h4>Freezing point depression</h4>
<p>Adding salt to a street lowers the temperature at which water turns into ice. This is freezing point
    depression:\[\Delta T_f=K_f m\]where \(K_f\) is the freezing point depression constant or cryoscopic constant, and
    \(m\) is the molal concentration of the solute. Again, \(K_f\) depends on the solvent, not the solute.</p>
<h4>Osmosis and osmotic pressure of solutions</h4>
<p>A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that only molecules or ions of a
    certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth are capable of passing (permeating) through it. These materials
    are referred to as semipermeable membranes. Diffusion-driven transfer of solvent molecules through a semipermeable
    membrane is known as osmosis (semipermeable membrane prevents the solute from transferring but allows the solvent).
</p>
<p>Say you have two tubes, one with pure solvent and one with a solution. A pure solvent will go through the membrane
    into a solution, causing the level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (weight of column of
    solution in the tube), resulting in solvent to go back into the pure solvent. When the osmotic pressure and
    hydrostatic pressure are equal, transfer of solvent is in equilibrium and you have reached the osmotic pressure
    \(\Pi\) of the solution:\[\Pi=MRT\]where \(M\) is the solute molarity, \(R\) is the universal gas constant, and
    \(T\) is the temperature.</p>
<p>If you apply pressure to the solution, you reverse osmosis and push solvent molecules from the solution into pure
    solvent. This is used for desalination of seawater.</p>
<h4>Hemolysis</h4>
<p>Solutions injected into the body should be isotonic with blood serum, aka they should have the same osmotic pressure
    as blood. If a less concentrated (hypotonic) solution is injected, water will pass into the blood cells, expand the
    cells, and rupture them, a process called hemolysis. On the other hand, if the solution is too concentrated
    (hypertonic), cells will lose water and possibly diein a process called crenation.</p>
<h4>Determination of molar mass</h4>
<p>Since osmotic pressure and changes in freezing point, boiling point, and vapor pressure are directly proportional to
    number of solute species present in a given amount of solution, you can measure these properties to find the
    solute's molar mass.</p>
<h4>Colligative properties of electrolytes</h4>
<p>So far, we have discussed nonelectrolyte solutions. Observations of colligative properties for electrolytes suggest
    that ions of sodium chloride and other strong electrolytes are not completely dissociated in solution. To account
    for this, the van't Hoff factor (\(i\)) is defined as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of
    formula units dissolved. For example, NaCl has a predicted \(i\) of 2 but only a measured \(i\) of 1.9 at a 0.050
    molality concentration.</p>
<p>Peter Debye and Erich Huckel proposed a theory to explain the apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes.
    They suggested that solvation of ions was not complete and some positive and negative ions continue to touch. Thus,
    the activity, or effective concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual
    concentration. Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, so in extremely dilute
    solutions, the effective concentrations of the ions are essentially equal to the actual concentrations.</p>
<h4>Colloids and suspensions</h4>
<p>Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of relatively large particles that are visible (eg. can be seen with
    a magnifying glass). They are cloudy and can settle out after mixing. Another class of mixtures is colloids (or
    colloidal dispersions) which exhibit properties intermediate between those of suspensions and solutions. The
    particles in a colloid are larger tha most simple molecules but do not settle out upon standing. An example is milk.
</p>
<h4>Tyndall effect</h4>
<p>The particles in a colloid are large enough to scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect, making
    colloidal mixtures appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams. Clouds are colloidal mixtures, and so are
    fog and smoke, which allows bright lights to be seen at night.</p>
<h4>Dispersion</h4>
<p>The particulate component typically present in a relatively minor amount in a colloid is called the dispersed phase
    and the substance or solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.</p>
<h4>Preparation of colloidal systems</h4>
<p>Colloids are prepared by producing particles of colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a
    dispersion medium. Particles of colloidal size are formed by 1) dispersion methods (breaking down larger particles)
    or 2) condensation methods (growth from smaller units). Gelatin, glue, starch, and dehydrated milk powder are solids
    that disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems in contact with water.</p>
<p>An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or blending two immiscible liquids, breaking one liquid into
    colloidal size and dispersing through the other liquid. This explains why oil spills can be difficult to clean up,
    because wave action causes emulsion of oil and water. Emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying agent, a
    substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. Milk is an emulsion of butterfat in water, with the
    proteni casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk
    components as emulsifying agents.</p>
<p>Clouds are an example of a colloidal system formed from condensation, where water molecules aggregate and form
    colloid-sized particles. If they coalesce and form large water droplets, that causes rain, sleet, or snow.</p>
<h4>Soaps and detergents</h4>
<p>Soap was made by boiling fats with a strongly basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate fro mwood ashes
    with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids. When these fats are treated with a base, glycerol and
    salts of fatty acids are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. Detergents (soap substitutes) also
    contain nonpolar hydrocarbon chains. The nonpolar end of a soap or detergent is attracted to oil, grease, or dirt,
    while the ionic end is attracted by water. So the soap or detergent molecules become oriented at the interface
    between dirt particles and water. These molecules that have both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic end are called
    amphiphilic. As a result, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are washed away. In other
    words, soaps and detergents makes it so that fats can dissolve in water by turning them into colloids, allowing you
    to wash the fats away.</p>
<h4>Electrical properties of colloidal particles</h4>
<p>Dispersed colloidal particles are often electrically charged. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges
    of the same sign, helping keeping them dispersed. This property can be used to remove them from a variety of
    mixtures. For example, smoke can be removed by attrating the charged particles to highly charged electrodes,
    neutralizing them and depositing them as dust.</p>
<h4>Gels</h4>
<p>Gelatin is a colloid. Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous mixture of gelatin coagulates as it cools,
    yielding an extremely viscous body known as a gel. A gel is a colloidal dispersion of a liquid phase throughout a
    solid phase. The fibers of the dispersing medium form a complex three-dimensional network, with interstices being
    filled with a liquid medium or a dilute solution of the dispersing medium.</p>

\section{Standing waves}
If you think about a wave that travels forward, hits something, and then goes back, if the wave moves at
specifically
the right frequency, then the waves will overlap perfectly together and create standing waves.

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{standing}

\section{Quantum theory}
De Broglie extended Einstein's wave-particle duality of light to material particles, stating that all particles with
a
mass and velocity also have wave-like behaviors, such as having a wavelength of $\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}=\frac{h}{p}$,
known as the \textbf{de Broglie wavelength}. This wavelength is a characteristic of particles, not electromagnetic
radiation. de Broglie's idea was that the electrons acted as circular standing waves such that only an integer
number of
wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit. Davisson and Germer demonstrated experimentally that electrons
exhibit
wavelike behavior by doing the double slit experiment with electrons.

The \textbf{Heisenberg uncertainty principle} states that it is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously
and
exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. This imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in
science
and is a consequence of wave-particle duality.
\[\Delta x \Delta p_x \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}\]

Schrodinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or \textbf{wavefunctions}, represented by the
Greek letter psi, $\psi$. Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction that electrons are still
particles,
and so the waves represented by $\psi$ are not physical waves but instead are complex probability amplitudes. The
square
of the magnitude of the wavefunction describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain
location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density
with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

\[\hat{\cal H}\psi=E\psi\]

$\hat{\cal H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the
quantum particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.

\section{Electron orbitals}
The four quantum numbers $n$, $\ell$, $m$, and $s$ specify the unique quantum state of a single electron in an atom,
called its wave function or orbital. An atomic orbital is a mathematical function describing the location and
wave-like
behavior of an electron in an atom. This function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron
of an
atom in any specific region around the atom's nucleus. Each orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons.
Electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels and not between them. Energy levels are counted starting
from 1. $n$ is the \textbf{principal quantum number}, and you can think of this as the energy level. It is also the
shell number. You can think of shells as concentric circles radiating from the nucleus. The higher the principal
quantum
number, the higher the energy level, the farther from the nucleus the electron is likely to be. $n$ can take on
values
$1,2,3...$, which is the realm of natural numbers, and so is discrete (cannot be 1.5, for example).

$\ell$ is the \textbf{secondary (angular momentum) or azimuthal or orbital quantum number}. It takes on the values
of
$\ell=0,1,2,...,n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have values of $\ell=0$, whereas an orbital with
$n=2$
can have values of $\ell=0,1$. Orbitals within the same angular quantum number reside in the same subshell.

The \textbf{s orbital, p orbital, d orbital, and f orbital} refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum numbers
$\ell=0,1,2,3$ respectively. The names come from description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali
metal
spectroscopic lines as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental. The s subshell looks like a sphere and the p
subshell
has a dumbbell shape. The d and f subshells look more complicated.

The number of \textbf{radial nodes} for a particular orbital is $n-\ell -1$. So the 3s ($n=3, l=0$) has $3-0-1=2$
radial
nodes. The number of \textbf{angular nodes} is equivalent to the azimuthal angular momentum number $\ell$.

The\textbf{ magnetic quantum number} $m_l$ specifies the spatial orientation of a particular orbital, and can take
on
the values $-\ell, -(\ell -1), ..., 0, ..., (\ell - 1), \ell$. These are the variations we're talking about when we
ask
how many orbitals in a shell. So in the s subshell ($\ell=0$), there is 1 possible magnetic quantum number (0). In
the p
subshell ($\ell=1$), the possible magnetic quantum numbers are -1, 0, 1. So s subshells have 1 orbital, p subshells
have
3 orbitals, d subshells have 5 orbitals, and f subshells have 7 orbitals. Remember that each orbital can have 2
electrons.

This last discrepancy formed when experiments showed that hydrogen-line spectra actually showed lines not in single
peaks but rather pairs of closely spaced lines, giving rise to Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have
the
fourth quantum number: the \textbf{spin quantum number}, or $m_s$. This spin is a completely quantum phenomenon with
no
analogues in the classical realm. It describes an intrinsic electron "rotation" or "spinning", where each electron
acts
as a tiny magnet or tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, although
this
rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates. So people realized that each orbital
actually
defines the location of two electrons, not one.

\textbf{Pauli exclusion principle} states that no two electrons can have the same set of all four quantum numbers.
Any
atomic orbital can have zero, one, or two electrons.

\section{Orbital energies}
Not all subshells in each energy level is actually higher level in energy than lower energy levels. If you look at
an
energy-level diagram, you will find that the 3d orbitals are actually higher energy than the 4s orbitals. Electrons
fill
in low-energy orbitals first, according to the \textbf{Aufbau principle}, which states that electrons occupy the
lowest
energy subshell first before entering higher-energy subshells. The arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an
atom
is called the electron configuration, denoted by the number of the principal quantum shell, the letter that
designates
the orbital type, and a superscript designating the number of electrons in that particular subshell.

The \textbf{Stern-Gerlach experiment} was heating and emitting silver atoms through a slit through a nonuniform
magnetic
field. A pair of electrons with opposite spins do not act as magnets. However, silver atoms have an unpaired
electron,
and this unpaired electron can spin up or down. They found half of Ag atoms were deflected upwards and half was
deflected downwards. Rather than being a continuous distribution, the detector detected discrete points of
accumulation
of atoms. This showed that angular-momentum was quantized in atomic-scale systems.

The \textbf{shielding effect} is when inner subshells prevent outer electrons from forming a strong attraction to
the
nucleus. s subshells are better at shielding than p > d > f. So you get atoms with lots of electrons with multiple
levels, you find that the f level in a lower energy level might be higher energy than the s level in a higher energy
level.

\textbf{Hund's rule} states that the lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of
degenerate
orbitals is that having the maximum number of unapired electrons. In other words, you want to place on electron in
each
degenerate orbital of a subshell before you start to fill them up and pair the electrons up.

Half-filled or completely filled d subshells are particularly stable arrangements of electrons, so an electron tends
to
be passed from the s-orbital to the d-orbital to generate half-filled or filled d subshells. This is apparent in the
electron configurations for Cr ([Ar]$4s^13d^5$), Mo ([Kr]$5s^14d^5$), Cu ([Ar]$4s^13d^{10}$), Ag
([Ar]$5s^14d^{10}$).

\section{Bond order}
Average bond order is the total number of bonds over the number of structures. For example, if there is one double
bond
and two single bonds, it is $\frac{1+1+2}{3}=1.33$. The calculated bond length is consistent with average bond
order.

When bonds are formed, energy is released, because bonds are the most stable (lowest energy) configuration for two
atoms
to exist next to each other. The opposite occurs when bonds are broken (energy is absorbed). This might be opposite
of
what you expect when you think of catabolism/anabolism, where anabolism (forming larger structures by linking
smaller
ones) seems to take energy. You'd think that... okay I'm using bonds to make something bigger, so why does that
energy
if you just said forming bonds releases energy? The difference here is that to make these larger molecules, you're
forming bonds that are more unstable than the bonds in the smaller molecules. So you're forming bonds, which
releases
energy, but you also need to break pretty stable bonds already, which takes more energy than the energy released by
forming the new bonds. This makes anabolic pathways endergonic processes, meaning requiring energy. You use energy
and
store that energy in less stable bonds in the larger molecule. Then, when you need that energy, you break those
unstable
bonds and form more stable ones in the products, thereby releasing energy.

\section{Periodic trends}
Groups of the periodic table exhibit similar chemical behavior because they have the same number and distribution of
electrons in their valence shells. As we go from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an electron to
the
valence shell. As the number of protons increase, effective nuclear charge $Z_\text{eff}$, or the pull exerted on a
specific electron by the nucleus taking into account electron-electron repulsion, increases. (For hydrogen, since it
only has only one electron, there is no repulsion/shielding and so technically its effective nuclear charge is the
same
as its nuclear charge.)
\[Z_\text{eff}=Z-\text{shielding}\]
Core electrons shield the valence electrons from getting close to the nucleus, but valence shell electrons do not
block
nuclear attraction as efficiently. Thus, as we go across a period, $Z$ increases by one (due to the additional
proton)
but shielding increases only slightly. Therefore, this increasing effective nuclear charge draws electrons closer to
the
nucleus, making covalent radii (half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms) smaller. As we go down
the
elements in a group, the number of electrons in the valence shell remain constant but the principal quantum number
increases by one each time, and so the radius increases (we're in a new shell at a higher energy level).

A cation compared to its element (Na+ vs Na) has fewer electrons but same number of protons and thus is smaller. V3+
is
smaller than V2+ because it has even fewer electrons. Anions increase the size of the atom. Atoms and ions that have
the
same electron configuration are said to be \textbf{isoelectronic}. For isoelectronic series, the number of protons
determines the size.

\textbf{Ionization energy} is the amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a gaseous
atom in its ground state. An atom can have multiple ionization energies for each successive electron being removed.
Energy is always required to remove electrons from atoms or ions, so ionization is endothermic. Whenever atomic
radii
are larger, ionization energy is lower, as the farther an electron is from the nucleus, the easier it is to pull
off. So
ionization energy increases across a period and decreases down a group. Exceptions to this rule occurs when you go
from
one subshell to the next (for example boron B starts the p subshell, which decreases ionization energy even though
it
has one more proton than beryllium Be). Another deviation occurs as orbitals become more than one-half filled. For
example, the ionization energy of oxygen O is lower than nitrogen N because N has the 2p orbital half-filled (one
electron in each orbital), which is more stable. Successive ionization energies for one element always increases. It
takes a lot of energy to remove a core electron, so for example, Ca2+ has a very high ionization energy because it
doesn't have any valence electrons left.

The \textbf{electron affinity} is the energy change for the process of adding an electron to a gaseous atom to form
an
anion (negative ion). This process can be endothermic or exothermic. The magnitude of electron affinity increases as
we
go across a period (becomes more negative or releases more energy), until you reach the noble gas which no longer
wants
electrons or a half-filled orbital. Electron affinity typically decreases (in magnitude) down a group, but the
second
element of a group typically has the highest magnitude electron affinity because the n=2 shell is small and results
in
large electron-electron repulsions. So even though chlorine Cl has a lower ionization energy due to shielding, it
has a
higher electron affinity than fluorine.

For most intents and purposes, you can think of ionization energy and electron affinity as similar things.
Ionization
energy is how hard it is to take an electron away from an atom, and electron affinity is how much the atom wants an
electron. So if it's really hard to take an electron away, then that atom probably also really wants an electron.
Just
remember that electron affinity is often negative since most atoms talked about are releasing energy, and so when I
say
that an atom has high electron affinity, I'm talking about the absolute value, not the actual numerical value. For
example, I'll say oxygen O has a much higher electron affinity (-141 kJ/mol) than lithium (-60 kJ/mol). Don't get
these
confused! Science is full of these confusing statements because it all depends on your reference point.

\section{Valence bond theory}
Quantum mechanics can account for areas where an electron might be located in an atom but not in a molecule. Valence
bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals. These single electrons in each
orbital overlap to form an electron pair with the covalent bond. This overlap decreases the energy overall in the
system, and the minimal distance where the bond is most stable determines the bond length. The overlap of two s
orbitals, the overlap of an s orbital and a p orbital, and the end-to-end overlap of two p orbitals all produce
sigma
bonds ($\sigma$). These are single bonds. A pi bond ($\pi$) results from the side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals.
Along the axis itself, there is a node, a plane with no probabliity of finding an electron. The first bond is a
sigma
bond, and then the additional bonds (double or triple) are pi bonds.

Bond dipole moments are measured in Debye and is charge times distance. For HCl, the bond dipole moment is 1.08 D,
whereas for HI, the bond dipole moment is known to be 0.44 D. So HI is less polar than HCl, which agrees with
differences in electronegativity. If there was a complete separation charge (aka an ionic bond), the bond dipole
moment
for HCl, whose bond length is 0.127 nm, would be
$(1.60\times10^{-19}\unit{C})(0.127\times10^{-9}\unit{m})(\frac{1\unit{D}}{3.336\times10^{-30}\unit{C.m}})=6.09\unit{D}$.
However, we know experimentally HCl is 1.03 D, so its ionic character is $1.03/6.09=17\%$.

Let's take H2O for example. Oxygen has the electron configuration $1s^22s^22p^4$, with two unpaired electrons in
each of
two 2p orbitals. So we would expect the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen to overlap with the 2p orbitals of the oxygen.
Since
p orbitals are perpendicular to each other, that would predict that the bond angle between the two OH bonds would be
90\degree. However, experimentally we find that it is 104.5\degree.

You might be wondering why do we care about this if we already have VSEPR. The thing is... VSEPR never looks at
orbitals. It doesn't take into account how orbitals fit into this whole electron pair geometry and molecular
structure
thing. So these advanced theories of bonding (valence bond, molecular orbital theory) take into account orbitals as
well.

To explain this is the concept of hybridization which is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of
atomic
orbitals (LCAO). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. Although the orbitals in an isolated
oxygen
atom are a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals, when the water molecule forms, they form four equivalent hybrid
orbitals
that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron. Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms, and
have
shapes and orientations very different from the atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. All orbitals in a set of hybrid
orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy. The type of hybrid orbitals depend on the electron-pair geometry as
predicted by VSEPR theory. Hybrid orbitals overlap to form sigma bonds, whereas unhybridized orbitals overlap to
form pi
bonds.

Valence bond theory basically states that even though in an isolated oxygen atom, the unpaired electrons are in the
p
subshell, when the oxygen bonds with the two hydrogen, it hybridizes all the orbitals it has floating around
(electrons
accounted for either in the bond or as lone pairs). So oxygen in H2O has 2 lone pairs and 2 bonds, so it uses 4
orbitals. So instead of 1 s orbital and 3 p orbitals, it hybridizes them to form 4 $\text{sp}^3$ orbitals. The two
lone
pairs hang out in 2 of these sp3 orbitals, and the bonding electrons hang out one in each of the other 2 sp3
orbitals.
The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom depends on its electron-pair geometry as predicted by VSEPR
theory.
If there are two things around the atom, it's linear and sp hybridization. If there's three, then it's sp2 and
trigonal
planar. If there's four, then it's sp3. If it's five, then it's sp3d, and then sp3d2. So let's say Cl-N-O. N has one
lone pair, a double bond to oxygen, and a single bond to chlorine. Before bonding, it has 2s2p3:
\includegraphics{ClNO.png}
\[\electron{2s}{\updwn}\quad \electron{2p}{\up\ \up\ \up}\]
Then, after it bonds, it turns 1 s orbital and 2 p orbitals (using 3 total since it has three groups of electron
density
around it) to turn into 3 sp2 orbitals, leaving the last p orbital unhybridized.
\[\electron{sp^2}{\updwn \up \up}\quad \electron{2p}{\up\ }\]
The first sp2 orbital is taken up by the lone pair. Then you place one electron each into the other two,
representing
one electron that the nitrogen will share with chlorine and one electron that it will share with oxygen. These two
electrons make up the two sigma bonds attached to nitrogen. But wait! What about the second bond with oxygen? That
electron results from the bonding of the unhybridized p orbital with the unhybridized p orbital of oxygen, and makes
up
a pi bond.

Let's take a look at oxygen in this same molecule. Isolated oxygen has 2s2p4 for its valence electrons:
\[\electron{2s}{\updwn}\quad \electron{2p}{\updwn\ \up\ \up}\]

After bonding, it has, similar to the nitrogen, 3 areas of electron density. So it takes 1 s orbital and 2 p
orbitals to
make 3 sp2 orbitals. It then takes its two sets of lone pairs and plops them in there, and then puts 1 into the last
sp2
orbital, and one into the unhybridized p orbital. That last sp2 orbital pairs with the orbital of nitrogen to form
the
sigma bond, and the unhybridized p orbital pairs with the p orbital of nitrogen to form the pi bond (double bond).
\[\electron{sp^2}{\updwn \updwn \up}\quad \electron{2p}{\up\ }\]

\section{Dimensional analysis}
For dimensional analysis, identify the units you are looking for, and then write down what you are given. Then use
ratios to cross out the units you don't need and end up with the units you do need. The units on the top need to be
the
same as the units on the top, and the units on the bottom need to be the same as the units on the bottom.

\section{Significant figures}
For multiplication and division, use the maximum number of sig figs in the values you are multiplying. For addition
and
subtraction, limit your answer to the rightmost column (after the decimal point) that all numbers have significant
figures in common.

\section{Atomic numbers/isotopes}
Atomic number is indicated by Z and is the number of protons in the nucleus. The mass number is A and is the number
of
nucleons in the atom (atoms is protons and neutrons). The average atomic mass is the average of masses of all
isotopes
of an element, calculated by multiplying the natural abundance of each isotope by its mass in amu and then summing
the
products.

A continuous spectrum

So the world is made out of \textbf{elements}. Elements combine together to form \textbf{molecules}. If a molecule
contains more than one type of element, it is a \textbf{compound}. If it contains only one element, then it's just
called an element; for example, N2 is a diatomic element. If you have multiple molecules together, you get a
\textbf{substance}. If the molecules that make up that substance are all the same, you have a pure substance. If
they
are not the same, you have a \textbf{mixture}. If the mixture changes from one place to the next, then it is a
\textbf{heterogeneous mixture}. If it's the same throughout, then it's a \textbf{homogeneous mixture}.

Molecules can exist in different phases. At low energy levels, they exist in solid and are dense. At higher energy
levels, have lower density, and higher entropy, and become liquid and conform to the shape of their container. With
even
more energy, the molecules become gas and now diffuse to fill up the volume and have even lower density and higher
entropy.

If you drop a soluble salt into water, the two ions in the salt will separate and enter the aqueous phase (aq). The
solution now contains the cation, or positive ion, and the negative ion, or anion, along with water. If the salt is
completely dissolved, then the solution is homogeneous as the ions will be evenly distributed throughout the
mixture.
The polarity of water stabilizes the ions and keeps them separate from each other. Solubility rules can determine
whether a salt will separate into its ions or not.

The periodic table has elements listed in order of their atomic number, which is also the number of protons in the
nucleus of the atom. One row (left to right) across the periodic table is called a period. One column (top to
bottom)
down the periodic table is called a group. \textbf{Nonmetals} appear dull, are poor conductors of heat and
electricity,
and appear on the right side of the periodic table and hydrogen. \textbf{Metalloids} are part metal, part nonmetal,
and
consist of 6 elements zigzagging down the right side of the periodic table, including B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, and Te.
Metals
are shiny, malleable, and good conductors of heat and electricity, and make up most of the periodic table. The first
group is \textbf{alkali metals}, the second group is alkaline earth metals, groups 3-12 are transition metals, group
15
are \textbf{pnictogens}, group 16 are \textbf{chalogens}, group 17 is \textbf{halogens}, and group 18 are the noble
gases. Lanthanides and actinides make up the two periods on the bottom. Groups 1-2, and 13-18 are known as the
main-group or representative elements. The inner transition metals are the two periods on the bottom and are
\textbf{lanthanides} and \textbf{actinides}.

The first set of reactions that can take place are \textbf{synthesis} reactions. This comes from two elements
joining
together to form a compound. An example is $2\ce{Al}(s)+3\ce{Cl_2}(g)\rightarrow 2\ce{AlCl_3}(s)$. The opposite of a
synthesis reaction is a \textbf{decomposition} reaction, in which a compound breaks down into more elementary
molecules.
Different molecules decompose in different ways. Metal carbonates decompose on heating to create a metal oxide and
carbon dioxide, such as $\ce{NiCO3}(s)\rightarrow \ce{NiO}(s)+\ce{CO2}(g)$. Metal hydrogen carbonates decompose on
heating to give metal carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water, such as $2\ce{NaHCO3}(s)\rightarrow
\ce{Na2CO3}(s)+\ce{H2O}(g)+\ce{CO2}(g)$. Many oxygen-containing compounds decompose on heating to yield oxygen gas
and
other compounds. For example, $\ce{H2O2}(aq)\rightarrow \ce{O2}(g)+\ce{H2O}(l)$.

A \textbf{single-replacement reaction} is where a metal replaces another metal. Whether a metal will replace another
metal depends on its position on a reactivity series, which ranks reactivity of metals from highest to lowest. Group
1A
metals are the most reactive because they all want to lose an electron to form a stable octet. A nonmetal can also
replace a nonmetal, for example, $\ce{PbCl4}(s)+2\ce{F2}(g)\rightarrow \ce{PbF4}(s)+2\ce{Cl2}(g)$.

When you add salt to water, you decrease its freezing point and increase its boiling point. The formula for the
extent
of depression can be estimated by Blagden's law: $\Delta T_F=K_F\cdot b \cdot i$, where $\Delta T_F$ is the
freezing-point depression, $K_F$ is the cryoscopic constant, which depends on the properties of the solvent, not the
solute, $b$ is the molality (moles solute per kilogram of solvent), and $i$ is the van't Hoff factor (number of ion
particles per formula unit of solute). Since you decrease the freezing point, that means water can be colder before
it
turns into ice, or hotter before it boils into steam. As for why, my friend Matt told me learned in physical
chemistry:
"it can all be explained in terms of entropy. Systems will gravitate towards ones with the most microstates
possible. In
the case of water and salt, when water is in liquid form the Na+ and Cl- ions are able to move throughout and so
there
are a ton of microstates available. When the water is in solid form, the ions cannot move and so there exists
magnitudes
of order lower microstates. Hence when you add salt to water it dramatically increases the relative number of
microstates in liquid vs solid form and so adds a driving force to keep it in liquid form. This is also why it
increases
the boiling point and allows water to become hotter and cook food faster." Amazing!

\section{Thermodynamics}
\textbf{Enthalpy} is the sum of the system's internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. It is a
state
function. It is a stand-in for energy in chemical systems. Bond, lattice, solvation and other "energies" in
chemistry
are just enthalpy differences. As a state function, enthalpy depends only on the final configuration of internal
energy,
pressure, and volume, not the path taken to achieve it. It is an extensive property and so is proportional to the
size
of the system. The intensive form of enthalpy is \textbf{specific enthalpy} ($\frac{H}{m}$) referenced to the unit
of
mass of the system, or \textbf{molar enthalpy} ($\frac{H}{n}$). In practice, a change in enthalpy is the preferred
expression for measurements at constant pressure because it simplifies the description of energy transfer. When
transfer
of matter into or out of the system is also prevented and no electrical or shaft work is done, at constant pressure
the
enthalpy change equals the energy exchanged with the environment by heat. The standard enthalpy of reaction is the
enthalpy change when reactants in their standard states (pressure is 1 bar and temperature is usually 298K) change
to
products in their standard states. This quantity is the standard heat of reaction at constant pressure and
temperature.
\[H=U+pV\]
Enthalpy $H$ of a thermodynamic system is defined as the sum of its internal energy $U$ and the product of its
pressure
$p$ and volume $V$.
