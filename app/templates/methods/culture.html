<h4>Prepare MEAs</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Coat the center of each well with PEI (0.1%).</li>
	<p class="minutiae">Concentration of supplied PEI is 50 wt.% in H2O. So need to dilute by 500. The goal volume is 100 ul per well. So for 6 wells total we will need 600 ul. So let's make 10ml total. So should be 20 ul PEI in 10 ml H2O. Add 100ul to the center of each well.</p>
	<li>Incubate at 37°C and 10% CO2 overnight.</li>
	<li>The following morning, rinse three times with sterile double de-ionized water and allow to dry.</li>
	<li>Add 10 microliters laminin (20 ug/ml) to center of each well and incubate at 37°C for 2 h. Remove laminin immediately before cell seeding.</li>
	<p class="minutiae">Concentration provided is 1.7 mg/ml. Should be thawed and kept at 4-8 degrees C. 1.7/x=0.02. So dilute by 85. If we want 1ml total, add 12 ul.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Primary DRG extraction and culture</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Isolate DRGs and place in ice-cold HBSS.</li>
	<li>Transfer to hood, and wash with washing medium (40ml HBSS + 0.132 ml 300x stock gentamycin + 0.4ml 100x stock kanamycin).</li>
	<li>Transfer to dissociation solution, consisting of collagenase (2 mg/ml) and DNase (0.1 mg/ml) and incubate for 40 min at 37°C.</li>
	<p class="minutiae">-1/12/22 Created 2x collagenase solution (4mg/ml) in HBSS; 2x dissociation solution: 4 mg/ml collagenase and 0.2mg/ml DNase. To make 6ml dissociation solution, dissolve 24mg collagenase IV in 6ml HBSS, filter-sterilize, and then add 62ul DNase. The DNase I is supplied by Thermo Fisher in a 20,000 Unit vial with a concentration varying form 50-375 U/ul. The specific activity of DNase I is typically in the range of 10,000-25,000 units/mg. Therefore:</p>
	$$0.1\text{mg DNase I}*\frac{17,500\text{ units}}{1 \text{ mg}}*\frac{1\text{ ul}}{338.5\text{ units}} = 5.17\text{ ul DNase I}$$
	<p class="minutiae">Since we're making 6ml of a 2x solution, we need to multiply this by 12.</p>
	$$5.17\text{ ul DNase I}*2*6=62.04\text{ ul DNase}$$
	<p class="minutiae">Make fresh collagenase solution (4mg/ml). Use ~4ml total 1x dissociation to allow for more tissue movement during digestion. So this means add 2ml collagenase (4mg/ml) to 2ml HBSS (with DRGs). 2ml collagenase at 4mg/ml = 8mg collagenase IV in 2ml HBSS. Filter-sterilize.</p>
	<li>After 40 min, add trypsin (0.025%) and incubate for an additional 5 min at 37°C.</li>
	<li>Triturate with fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette until solution appears homogeneous.</li>
	<li>Pass solution through 70-um nylon filter, and triple the volume with DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS to quench trypsinization.</li>
	<li>Centrifuge cells (10 min at 600g) and resuspend in fresh complete medium (DMEM/F-12 + GlutaMAX, 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 5 ng/ml GDNF).</li>
	<p class="minutiae">To make 20ml of complete cell medium, we need 20ml DMEM/F12 + 200 ul of GlutaMAX 100X + 2 ml FBS + 200 ul P/S + 100ng. GDNF should be diluted in 0.1% BSA. We have 7.5% BSA in DPBS, so dilute by factor of 75 to make a total of 1ml = 14 ul BSA with 986 ul of DPBS, making 1 ml of 0.1% BSA. The GDNF (total 10ug) was aliquoted into 10 parts, each one with 1ug in 100ul of 0.1% BSA, making concentration 10ug/1ml. So each 1ml of complete medium should have 5 ng, or 1/200 of 100ul. Meaning every 2 ml of media should have 1 ul of GDNF solution.</p> 
	<li>Seed 5-10 ul containing an estimated 10,000 cells at the center of each MEA device.</li>
	<li>Incubate at 37°C and 10% CO2 for 30 min to allow cells to adhere.</li>
	<li>Carefully flood each well with 600 ul of fresh, preheated complete cell medium.</li>
	<li>Incubate plates at 37°C, 10% CO2, and 95% humidity.</li>
	<li>Replace media after the first 24 h and every alternate day afterwards.</li>
	<li>After nonneuronal cells reach 90% confluence (DIV 5-7), supplement media with mitotic inhibitors uridine (17.5 ug/ml) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (7.5 ug/ml).</li>
	<p class="minutiae">17.5 ug/ml * 2 ml
		uridine: in 2ml of solution we want 35 ug 3500ug or 3.5 mg in 2ml, then add 20ul
		5-fluoro: in 2ml of solution we want 15 ug, dilute 1500 ug or 1.5mg in 2ml, then add 20ul
</ol>

<p>2/15/21 Plated 6 wells of DRGs (~28 total DRGs from 2 mice) concentrations ~60K, 30k, 20k, 20k, 10k, 10k cells (neuronal and non-neuronal) first column of Axion 96-well plate</p>
<p>2/16/21 Plated 10 more wells of DRGs (2 more mice) to fill first two columns of Axion 96-well plate. Attempted 1x, 2x, 5x DRGs but couldn't get a cell pellet.</p>
<p>2/21/21 Added mitotic inhibitors to wells 1-6.</p>
