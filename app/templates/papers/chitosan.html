  <p>A cut nerve can be joined together again with direct suturing of the two ends. However, if the cut area is too long, then suturing the two ends would require stretching the nerve, which often leads to repair failure. In these cases, the injury can be repaired with with a nerve graft from the same organism (autograft) or a different organism (allograft). However, donor tissue is often limited. Therefore, neural tissue engineering has focused on the development of artificial nerve guidance conduits. The creation of these artificial conduits, known as entubulation, involves enclosing the nerve ends and the gap between them in a tube made of biological or synthetic materials, combining many elements including a scaffold structure and material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors, and biomimetic materials.</p>

    <p>This work compared the effectiveness of a collagen conduit treated with Matrilin-2 (MATN2) and lysine-enhanced chitosan to that of an untreated collagen conduit. MATN2 is a matrillin protein, which form a filamentous pericellular network connected to collagen fibrils and proteoglycans. MATN2 has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and Schwann cell migration. Chitosan is a sugar produced from chitin, the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans, which can enhance adherence of nerve cells and act as a scaffold in the conduit.</p>
    <p>The group performed a 10mm sciatic neurectomy of the left hindlimb and had three test groups: untreated collagen conduit (UC), treated conduit with MATN2 and Chitosan (TC), and reverse autograft (RA). At 12 weeks, they performed walking track assessment, measured the compound action potential (CMAP), weighed the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles, and stained the distal graft for Toluidine Blue (nerve morphology) and S-100 (Schwann cells).</p>

    <p>They found that TC was better than UC for walking force and CMAP but not statistically different from RA, indicating functionally, treatment with MATN2 and chitosan was effective. However, muscle weight and axon count was not as good as RA. Schwann cells had a large growth cone with broader migration compared in the TC condition than UC condition.</p>
