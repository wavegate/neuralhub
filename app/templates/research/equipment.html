<p><b>Culver Lab</b></p> 
<p><b>Prototype Large Field-of-View Two Photon Microscopy System</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Fast Large FOV Two-Photon Microscopy system: includes a Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai Tai HPDS, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, USA), an electro-optic modulator (350-80-LA-02, Conoptics, Danbury, USA), dichroic mirror (FF775-Di01-60x84, Semrock, Rochester, USA) and emission filters (FF01-680/SP-50.8-D, Semrock and ET525/36m, Chroma, Foothill Ranch, USA). The signal is then amplified with a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA60, Thorlabs), low-pass filtered (≤500 kHz passband, EF506, Thorlabs), and digitized (PCIe- 6353, National Instruments, Austin) before collection by a computer. Control of the electronics and image construction are then performed using custom written software (MATLAB, MathWorks, Natick, USA). Provides fields of view as large as 5 mm using an objective with NA=0.28, and resolution as high as 0.8 microns using an NA=0.9.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Optical Intrinsic Signal Imaging System and Associated Hardware</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The basic infrastructure for in vivo imaging in our lab consists of two optical intrinsic signal imaging systems (OIS) for imaging awake and anesthetized animals. The OIS systems are comprised of a 4-channel LED module, custom built LED drivers, EMCCD cameras (iXon 897, Andor Technologies), Schneider and Nikon Lenses, data acquisition control cards, boards and cables (National Instruments), Dell Workstation running Windows 7, Matlab Software for computer control of hardware, micromanipulators (World Precision Instruments), stereotactic holder, temperature controlled heating pads (TC electronic), Olympus surgery microscope, Mouse Pulse Oximeter (Starr Life Sciences), Infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus), optogenetic stimulus lasers (473nm, 200mW, SLOC), and galvanometer scanning mirrors (Thorlabs).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Small animal fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>We have developed a custom, small animal diffuse fluorescence tomography system (running at a FMT frame rate of 0.01Hz) that uses a high-speed EMCCD camera (iXon 877f, Andor Technologies), XY galvonometer (Model 6230 Cambridge Technology, Inc.), and various laser diodes (Patwardhan, Optics Express, 2005). A second system is similar but also capable of time-resolved implementation. The pulsed light source is a Ti:Sapphire oscillator (MTS, Kapteyn-Murnane Labs) that is pumped by a 6W 532 DPSS laser (Verdi, Coherent). The time-resolved detector is a gated intensified CCD system (PicoStarHR-12, LaVision (?gate <300ps)). Both measurements of absorption and scattering (Patwardhan, et al. Journal of Biomedical Optics 2007) and fluorescence lifetime (Nothdurft, et al. Journal of Biomedical Optics, 2009) have been demonstrated.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Functional diffuse optical tomography for human brain imaging</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Large field-of-view, high density diffuse optical tomography system</u>, 96 source channels and 96 detector channels depending on the imaging cap used. Illumination for the source channels is from LEDs, each with a dedicated, high-bandwidth (20 MHz) digital I/O line that can be individually programmed, maintaining full encoding flexibility with very low source channel crosstalk. The two wavelengths (750 nm and 850 nm) at each source positions are modulated at different frequencies, and source positions are time-encoded. Source positions separated sufficiently in space can be illuminated simultaneously with different frequency encoding. The frequency-, time-, and spatial-encoding of the instrument results in a full frame rate of >10 Hz. Light from the sources is carried to and from the subject’s head in optical fiber bundles (2.5mm diameter, 3m length). Detector channels have dedicated avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and channel dedicated 24-bit ADC. All data is spooled directly to hard disk in real time with 96 kHz sampling. A second portable system has similar design to the original fixed system but with 36 source x 32 detector sampling. Images are reconstructed using both NIRFAST (Dartmouth), a Finite Element Modeling package for DOT, and custom inversion routines (Culver, J.P. et al. Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, 2003, Zeff et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2007, Eggebrecht, et al. NeuroImage 2012, Zhan, et al, Frontiers in Neuroenergetics 2012).</li>
	<li><u>Portable 72 channel system.</u> The portable system is specifically designed for clinical studies, similar to above but with ¾ of the channel count.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>General electro-optic equipment</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>The basic infrastructure for biomedical optics development is in place including: mechanical isolation optical tables, translation stages, mounting hardware, optical fiber polishing equipment, basic optic sets including a selection of lenses, microscope objectives, mirrors, Vis-NIR filter set, Neutral Density Filter Set, Newport 830C Power Meter, USB2000-VIS-NIR Ocean Optics spectrometer, 300 MHz Tektronix digital scope, digital machine vision camera (10 bit, 1.3 mega pixel 33 fps, firewire Pixel Link), and 16 bit multifunctional data acquisition cards, (National Instruments 6053).</li>

<p><b>Computer - Culver lab</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Culver’s Lab has 2 Linux-based (CentOS) server-style processing computers: an 8-core (Intel Xeon E607 2.27 GHz processors) with 106 GB of RAM and a 48-core (Intel Xeon E5-2697v2 2.7 GHz processors) with 252 GB of RAM, as well as 8 Windows7-based DELL PC Workstations. All machines network through the NIL and MIR systems to run custom functional neuroimaging software applications and to allow HIPAA- secure, coordinated maintenance of research subject electronic records and tracking databases; operate a variety of basic and/or specialized software applications (e.g., SPSS, SAS, and MATLAB). The Computer Support Group (CSG) provides technical support on all network and departmental PC computers and workstations and maintains a BlueArc server for long-term data storage and archiving.
