<h3>Specific Aims</h3>
<p>Low back pain affects up to 85% of the population and is the leading cause of disability worldwide [1]. While intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is associated with low back pain in up to 40% of cases [2], a role for the IVD as a “pain generator” remains poorly understood. While nerve impingement is a clear contributor to pain in IVD degeneration, pain phenotypes may also arise from non-contacting “cross-talk” between degenerated IVDs and sensory nerves involved in transmitting pain to the central nervous system. To date, our understanding of nervous system-IVD “cross-talk” with IVD degeneration consists of protein expression changes in IVD, DRG and spinal cord tissues, IVD conditioned media or DRG neurons. Newer approaches to imaging neuronal activation [3,4,5,6], together with established pre-clinical models of IVD degeneration, <u>provide an opportunity to study remodeling of DRG neuronal function subsequent to IVD injury and onset of IVD degeneration.</u></p>
<p>In prior work, we showed that lumbar disc injury (L5-L6) led to IVD degeneration in the rat and was
associated with functional changes to isolated DRG neurons in vitro that involved impaired activation of the heat- sensitive TRPV1 channel [7]. In addition to the obvious limitation that we studied activation of only one ion channel, dissociation of cells from intact DRGs will affect their excitability and cause loss of neighboring interactions that affect neuronal activation. Here we propose a multi-arm approach to evaluate the temporal onset of <u>molecular and functional changes to lumbar DRG neurons in the intact DRG in vitro and in vivo following injury-induced IVD degeneration in the mouse.</u></p>
<p><b>Specific Aim 1. Evaluate temporal changes to pain-related behavior & sensitivity, & molecular changes in IVD and innervating DRGs in a mouse model of lumbar disc puncture (LDP).</b> We will induce LDP via a ventral stab to the L5-L6 IVD in a Thy1-GCaMP6s mouse model, in order to monitor activation of the Ca2+ sensitive indicator, GCaMP6s expressed in sensory nerves under control of the Thy1 promoter. Longitudinal monitoring of behavior and sensitivity, and contrast-enhanced microCT, will be performed in injured and sham- operated mice from pre-operative times to 52 weeks after surgery. Cohorts will be sacrificed at 6, 12, 36 and 52 weeks for harvest of innervating DRGs (L1-L4) and injured and adjacent IVDs. DRGs will be immunolabeled for presence of neuronal markers and neurotrophins, as well as key ion channels (e.g., Nav1.x, x=5 to 9, TRPA1 and TRPV1) involved in sensory nerve transmission. Whole bloc IVDs will also be studied for visualization of nerve fiber infiltration and morphology via second harmonic generation following IVD degeneration. <u>Our goal is to establish temporal and spatial patterns for molecular changes to IVD and DRGs for this model, and to test for predictive relationships between injured IVD and the innervating lumbar DRGs.</u></p>
<p><b>Specific Aim 2. Evaluate temporal changes to action potential-driven Ca2+ transients in lumbar DRG neurons following LDP in a mouse model.</b> We have developed methods to visualize Ca2+ transients in intact DRG organs obtained from Thy1-GCamp6s mice following electric field stimulation (EFS). Organ culture provides great advantage over studying isolated and dissociated neurons, while EFS provides the advantage of simultaneous excitation of action potentials in multiple neuronal populations [8, 9]. Here, mice will undergo surgery as described in Specific Aim 1 and cohorts will be sacrificed for fresh harvest of DRGs (L1-L4) and injured and adjacent IVDs. DRGs (L1-L4) will be cultured and exposed to EFS voltage sweep to measure threshold voltage and 50% maximum (IC50) for the population of neurons studied, and nearest neighbor responses. DRGs will also be tested before and after incubation with sodium channel blockers (Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and tetradotoxin-sensitive channels) to screen for remodeling of specific ion channel function following LDP injury. From the same animals, motion segments will be isolated for IVD organ culture in vitro to measure inflammatory mediator release. <u>Our goal is to test for temporal and spatial changes in DRG function and IVD pathology with IVD degeneration, and test for relationships to mouse behavior and sensitivity, to identify timepoints and novel targets that may be involved in the transition from acute to chronic discogenic pain.</u></p>
<p><b>Specific Aim 3. Evaluate sensory stimuli-induced responses in DRG neurons in living mice using in vivo fluorescence microscopy.</b> Methods to image Ca2+ transients in DRG of living mice have emerged using GCaMP-expressing mice and confocal microscopy [3, 5, 10-12]. Working with 2-photon confocal microscopy and motion correction algorithms developed for brain imaging, we will identify the threshold response of DRG neurons following in vivo stimulation of brush, pinch, heat and cold in living mice in the LDP and sham-operated groups. <u>Our goal is to test for relationships between in vivo activation patterns in lumbar DRGs with mouse- specific behavioral and sensitivity changes following onset of IVD degeneration to infer a pattern for acute and chronic changes at select DRGs in response to IVD injury.</u></p>
<p>Completion of this study would identify functional changes to sensory neurons and novel molecular targets at sites distant to the degenerated IVD. This would reveal novel information about IVD-nervous system “cross-talk” that may suggest novel interventions for treatment of discogenic pain.</p>
