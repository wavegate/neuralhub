<h4>Transgenic mouse model (Frank)</h4>
<p>The Thy1-GCaMP6s/GP4.3 mouse model (Jackson Labs) will be used to allow for monitoring of the fluorescent calcium-sensitive molecule, GCaMP6s, in excitatory neurons for Aims 2 and 3. A total of 16 mice will be used in this cohort (4 per group sham/LDP x GCaMP6s+/-). All mice will undergo lumbar disc puncture surgery with retrograde labeling, and eventual sacrifice, DRG & IVD harvest. After sacrifice, GCaMP6s-negative mice will undergo contrast-enhanced microCT of the disc and (possible) IVD organ culture. GCaMP6s-positive mice will undergo behavioral testing and electrical field stimulation of the DRG, and immunolabeling of the IVD and DRG. All mice will be bred and housed in the Clinical Sciences Research Building (CSRB) on the WashU Medical Campus.</p>
<h4>Surgical model to induce lumbar disc puncture (LDP) (Gupta/Tang)</h4>
<p>(to be updated) At 8 weeks of age, all mice will undergo a procedure for LDP as performed previously at the Musculoskeletal Research Center (MRC). Mice will be maintained under 1-3% isoflurane anesthesia via nose cone. First, we mark the incision site as ~ ¼” below, ¾” above the iliac wings and wash and prep appropriately. With a #11 blade, a vertebral incision is made over the abdomen vertically. Subcutaneous flaps (using tenotomy scissors) superficial to the abdominal muscle will be made, followed by gentle lifting of the abdominal musculature with forceps. This procedure facilitates closure. The peritoneal cavity is identified and the animal rotated on its right side to allow for left lateral displacement of the viscera, irrigating in saline-moistened sterile gauze. Using the blunt end of a Senn retractor, tissue overlying the retroperitoneum will be dissected under microscopic visualization and the aorta and IVC will be visualized. Gentle scraping of the aspects lateral (left) to this structure will allow for visualization of the vertebral bodies and identification of the L4-L5 and L5-L6 IVDs. In the LDP group, the lateral aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-L6 IVDs will be punctured 3x times with a 30G needle to a depth of ?mm; in the sham group, no instrument directly touches any IVD. When needed, we deliver 2 ul solution of DiI (2% in 10% DMSO) to the punctured IVDs via the 33G needle and close with cyanoacrylate, allowing 5 min for drying before closing. The abdominal muscles will be closed with 3-0 vicryl, then skin with 4-0 nylon suture. Planar X-rays of the whole mouse will be obtained via digital X-ray (Faxitron Multifocus) immediately after surgery to confirm location and degree of injury.</p>
<h4>Behavioral testing (Frank)</h4>
<p>All behavioral assessments will be performed in the MRC. Animals will be acclimated to investigator handling over 7 days and then subsequently acclimated to behavioral testing over 4 consecutive days prior to behavioral assessments. Pre-operative baseline behavior assay will be conducted the week leading up to the surgery, and then performed weekly until 4 weeks post-operatively. Behavioral assays will include Open Field, Voluntary Running Wheel, mechanical sensitivity via Electronic Von Frey, hindpaw heat sensitivity via Hargreaves Method, and hindpaw cold sensitivity via Cold Plantar Assay. For the Open Field, we will use a computer-assisted digital optical animal activity system (Omnitech Electronics). The voluntary running wheel will utilize the Bioseb Activwheel. Mechanical sensitivity will be assessed with Bioseb electronic von Frey filaments on the plantar surface of hind paws. Cold sensitivity will be measured using Cold Plantar Assay, in which a syringe filled with compressed dry ice is applied to the glass surface beneath the plantar surface of the hindpaw. Heat sensitivity will be assessed using the Hargreaves test, where a radiant heat source will be focused on the plantar surface of the hind paw [<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>
<h4>Sacrifice and tissue harvest (Frank)</h4>
<p>Four weeks postoperatively, mice will be sacrificed via carbion dioxide inhalation and intact DRGs (bilateral L1-L4) or lumbar IVDs (L5-L6 and two adjacent lumbar levels L3-L4 and L4-L5) will be harvested according to group. DRG harvest will be done via a ventral approach involving removal of the vertebral bodies exposing the ventral side of the vertebral canal allowing access to the dorsal nerve roots [<a href="#3">3</a>].</p>
<h4>Electrical field stimulation (Frank)</h4>
<p>Isolated intact lumbar DRGs will be placed in the center of a recording chamber, secured by a nylon mesh, and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 2 ml/min. Two electrodes connected to a pulse generator (Grass SD9) will be inserted at opposite ends of the chamber and DRGs will be stimulated with bipolar square pulses (1ms, 10Hz, 19s rest) at voltage amplitudes from 5-100V. GCaMP66s fluorescence change over time will be imaged at 488/510 nm with a spinning disc confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti2). A histogram of DRG neuron threshold voltages will be obtained. Dependence of action potential generation upon Nav1.x channels will be assessed using a pan-Nav channel blocker (tetrodotoxin, TTX 50nM). A dose response curve will be generated for varying concentrations of TTX 0.5-100 nm.</p>
<h4>Contrast-enhanced microCT (CEmCT) of the IVD (Tang/Remy)</h4>
<p>Structural changes of harvested IVD tissue will be monitored via CEmCT (to be updated).</p>
<h4>IVD organ culture and characterization of conditioned media (Tang/Remy)</h4>
<p>Isolated IVD organs will be cultured for up to 21-days post-sacrifice in 24-well plates, with each well containing 2 ml of 1:1 DMEM:F12 (with 20% FBS and 1% pen-strep). Media will be collected at 48 hours and frozen at -80 C until analyzed via multiplex assay for simultaneous quantification of 13 mouse cytokines.</p>
<h4>Immunohistochemistry of DRGs and IVDs (Liufang)</h4>
<p>Subsequent to EFS experiments, DRGs will be immunolabeled for presence of CGRP, PGP9.5, select voltage-gated sodium channels, TRPA1 and TRPV1. The % of neurons and MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) for each protein target will be quantified for each level (L1, L2, L3 & L4) to test for spatial and temporal pattern of neuronal remodeling after LDP. The % of DiI+ neurons positive will be quantified.</p>
<p>Subsequent to IVD organ culture, thick (~ 500 um) IVD blocks will be immunolabeled with PGP9.5 to visualize nerve fiber density, tortuosity, connectivity, and overall length of immunolabeled structure.</p>
