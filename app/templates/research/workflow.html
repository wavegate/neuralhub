<h4>Transgenic mouse model (Frank)</h4>
<p>The Thy1-GCaMP6s/GP4.3 mouse model (Jackson Labs) will be used to allow for monitoring of the fluorescent calcium-sensitive molecule, GCaMP6s, in excitatory neurons for Aims 2 and 3 [1]. A total of 16 mice will be used in this cohort. Eight of these mice will be GCaMP6s-positive (GCaMP+) and eight will be GCaMP6s-negative (GCaMP-). Within each of these groups, half (4) will undergo sham surgery and half will undergo lumbar disc puncture to induce disc degeneration. All mice will be bred and housed in the Clinical Sciences Research Building (CSRB) on the WashU Medical Campus. <b>In Cohort A (first cohort with surgery on October 5th, 2021), all mice will be GCaMP6s negative.</b></p>
<h4>Surgical model to induce lumbar disc puncture (LDP) (Gupta/Frank)</h4>
<p>At 8 weeks of age, mice will undergo either sham surgery or lumbar disc puncture at the Musculoskeletal Research Center (MRC). The surgery uses a lateral retroperitoneal approach to the mouse lumbosacral spine and is expected to take approximately 15 minutes. First, mice will be placed under 3% isoflurane in an isoflurane chamber to induce anesthesia and then maintained under 1.5% isoflurane via nose cone. The skin overlying the left hindlimb and lumbar spine will be shaved and prepped with ethanol and betadine. A dose of lidocaine (0.03ml for 20g, or 7 mg/kg?) is administered to the same area. The mouse is draped and placed on a heating pad. An approximately 1 cm incision is made overlying the left pelvis. The underlying fat pad and anterior margin of the thigh is separated and retracted to expose the retroperitoneal space by blunt dissection. The bilateral psoas muscles are visualized and separated apart gently with a cotton-tipped applicator to expose the lumbar IVD, taking extra care to avoid disturbing the intra-abdominal great vessels. In the disc puncture group, the surface of the IVD will be punctured 3x times with a 30G needle (##do we want a specific depth?## to a depth of 1mm); in the sham group, the IVD is exposed but is left untouched.</p>

<caption><b>Figure 1: Lateral retroperitoneal approach to the mouse lumbosacral spine</b> (A):  The palpatable superficial anatomical landmarks are denoted by 1) the blue dotted line which outlines anterior margin of the thigh and bony prominence of the pelvis, and 2) the red dotted line which outlines the fat pad located between the thigh and abdominal wall.  The black solid line is an approximately 1 cm incision along the pelvis line that reveals the surgical access point adjacent to the anterior thigh. (B and C): The access point to the retroperitoneal space lies between the blue and red dotted lines.  The underlying fat pad and anterior margin of the thigh can be easily separated and retracted to expose the retroperitoneal space by blunt dissection. (D): The pelvis is rotated posteriorly to expose a broad working space by gripping (a) with forceps.

<h4>Retrograde labeling of IVD and postoperative monitoring (Gupta/Frank)</h4>
<p>During the third puncture, the needle will be inserted to a depth of 1 mm, and a dose of 3 uL of Fluoro-Ruby solution (10% m/v diluted in distilled water, Invitrogen, Catalog No. D1817) will be gradually injected with a Hamilton microsyringe over 1 minute. The needle will then be withdrawn. The hole will then be sealed with cyanoacrylate, which is given 5 minutes to dry. Afterwards, the abdominal muscles will be closed with 4-0 vicryl running suture, then skin with 4-0 monofilament interrupted suture.</p>
<p>After skin closure, a dose of carprofen (5 mg/kg or 0.12ml for 20g mouse) will be administered intraperitoneally. Mice are observed continuously until animal regains use of its ipsilateral hind leg and is able to move around the cage. Mice are thereafter monitored every 6-8 hours for wound healing and mobility. Chewable carprofen tablets are additionally administered as needed (1.25 mg/mouse). Infection, signs of moderate to severe pain or distressed not anticipated by the study plan, mutilation of operative site or other self-mutilation will require veterinary consultation. Neurological or cardiopulmonary disorders not anticipated by the study plan, and non-weight bearing for 72 hours will require euthanasia as a humane endpoint.</p>
<h4>Behavioral testing (Frank)</h4>
<p>All behavioral assessments will be performed in the MRC. Animals will be acclimated to investigator handling over 7 days and then subsequently acclimated to behavioral testing over 4 consecutive days prior to behavioral assessments. Pre-operative baseline behavior assay will be conducted the week leading up to the surgery, and then behavioral assessments will be performed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-operatively. Each day, mice are left undisturbed in the testing environment for one hour before assays begin.</p>
<p>Voluntary locomotor activity will be assessed using the Omnitech Electronics Superflex open field system. Mice are placed into the center of a clear, open 16"x16" Plexiglass chamber. The location of the mice are tracked with infrared photosensors for 30 minutes. General locomotor activity (distance traveled, time spent traveling) is acquired using AccuScan Fusion software (Omnitech).</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/openfield.png') }}">
<p>Voluntary locomotor activity will also be assessed using the BIO-ACTIVW-M, Bioseb running wheel. Tests occur in a cage similar to the mice's home cage, with the exception of the addition of a 35 x 20 x 13 cm wheel. The Bioseb software analyzes wheel activity, including distance traveled, mean speed, maximum speed, and total active time. The animal spends 12 hours in this cage.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/wheel.png') }}">
<p>Mechanical sensitivity will be assessed with Bioseb electronic von Frey filaments on the plantar surface of hind paws. Mice are placed into clear observation enclosures with an open floor placed atop a wire grid to allow access to the plantar surface of the subject's feet. We wait for the mice to become still with no walking or rearing. For each foot (left and right), a soft tip of 0.5 mm diameter is applied to the mid-plantar surface of the hindpaw of the mouse with increasing force. The force at which the foot is withdrawn is measured by the system and displayed with a resolution of 0.1g and recorded. A withdrawal response is defined as flicking or licking of the stimulated paw. Gradual movement of the paw away from the stimulator will not be considered a withdrawal response; in this case, the trial will be re-attempted. The trial is repeated for a total of 2 datapoints, which is then averaged. </p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/evf.jpg') }}">
<p>Cold sensitivity will be measured using a simplified Cold Plantar Assay, in which a syringe filled with compressed dry ice is applied to the glass surface beneath the plantar surface of the hindpaw [Brenner 2015]. Mice are placed into a clear observation enclosure placed on top of a glass floor. Dry ice is crushed into a fine powder and compressed into a 3 ml syringe with its end cut off. The flat surface of the dry ice is pushed against the glass surface underneath the mouse hindpaw and a hand-timer is started. The stimulus is applied and the timer continues until the mouse permanently moves the paw away from the stimulated surface, or until 20 seconds. The stimulation will be repeated until at least 3 values on each hindpaw of the animal is collected. Trials testing opposite paws on the same mouse will be separated by at least 7 minutes, and trials testing the same paw will be separated by at least 15 minutes. Note that in the original paper, Brenner first cools the glass before administering cold stimuli. This might have to be done if things don't work.</p>

A dry ice pellet is applied to the underside of the glass underneath the hindpaw, and the latency to withdraw from the cooling glass is measured.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Heat sensitivity will be assessed utilizing the Hargreaves method, where a radiant heat source will be focused on the plantar surface of the hind paw (IITC Plantar Analgesia Meter). Mice are placed into clear observation enclosures with an open floor placed atop a wire grid to allow access to the plantar surface of the subject's feet. We wait for the mice to become still with no walking or rearing. A light beam, initially in an idle state, is positioned to focus on a 4x6mm spot on the paw. The heat source is then gradually intensified up to a pre-set temperature. The temperature at which the foot is withdrawn is recorded. A humane cut-off occurs at ??. The stimulation will be repeated until at least 3 values on each hindpaw of the animal is collected. Trials testing opposite paws on the same mouse will be separated by at least 7 minutes, and trials testing the same paw will be separated by at least 15 minutes.</p>

<h4>Sacrifice, IVD and DRG harvest (Frank)</h4>
<p>Four weeks postoperatively, intact DRGs (bilateral L1-L4) and lumbar IVDs (L5-6 and an adjacent level) will be harvested. First, the animal is euthanized via carbion dioxide inhalation. A transcardial perfusion is performed with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, 124 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM D-glucose, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4) after which DRG tissues are isolated via a dorsal approach. Following a midline dorsal incision, paraspinal muscluature, connective tissue, and fat are carefully removed with micro-dissection scissors to reveal the dorsal bony elements of the spine. Micro-rongeurs are then used to perform a multi-level laminectomy to expose the spinal cord, which is gently repositioned to expose the DRGs at each spinal level. Fine forceps are used to grasp the distal nerve root and gently remove the DRG from the neuroforamen, and spring scissors are used to carefully cut the nerve roots proximal and distal to the DRG. The vertebral column ventral to the spinal cord is isolated and frozen for microCT. Isolated DRGs are incubated in aCSF and used for EFS experiments within 8 h of isolation.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/laminectomy.jpg') }}">
<h4>Electrical field stimulation (Frank)</h4>
<p>Isolated intact lumbar DRGs will be placed in the center of a recording chamber, secured by a nylon mesh, and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 2 ml/min. Two electrodes connected to a pulse generator (Grass SD9) will be inserted at opposite ends of the chamber and DRGs will be stimulated with bipolar square pulses (1ms, 10Hz, 19s rest) at voltage amplitudes from 5-100V. GCaMP66s fluorescence change over time will be imaged at 488/510 nm with a spinning disc confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti2). A histogram of DRG neuron threshold voltages will be obtained. Dependence of action potential generation upon Nav1.x channels will be assessed using a pan-Nav channel blocker (tetrodotoxin, TTX 50nM). A dose response curve will be generated for varying concentrations of TTX 0.5-100 nm.</p>
<h4>Contrast-enhanced microCT (CEmCT) of the IVD (Tang)</h4>
<p>Structural changes of harvested IVD tissue will be monitored via CEmCT. Functional Spine Units (FSUs) containing an intact intervertebral disc sandwiched by the intact end-plate and vertebrae on both ends are dissected from the freshly frozen vertebral column. These FSUs are incubated in a 1ml solution of 50mg/ml Ioversol (from a stock solution of 350 mg/ml Ioversol) and 1% penstrep in 1ml PBS at 37C. After a one-day incubation period, the sample is prepared for day 0 scan. Samples are scanned using a VivaCT40 at 45kVp, 177uA, high resolution, 300ms integration, and 10um voxel size (Scanco Medical, CH). After each microCT scan the sample is returned to the incubation solution.</p>
<h4>IVD organ culture and characterization of conditioned media (Tang)</h4>
<p>(To be updated) Isolated IVD organs will be cultured for up to 21-days post-sacrifice in 24-well plates, with each well containing 2 ml of 1:1 DMEM:F12 (with 20% FBS and 1% pen-strep). Media will be collected at 48 hours and frozen at -80 C until analyzed via multiplex assay for simultaneous quantification of 13 mouse cytokines.</p>
<h4>Immunohistochemistry of DRGs and IVDs (Liufang)</h4>
<p>(To be updated) Subsequent to EFS experiments, DRGs will be immunolabeled for presence of CGRP, PGP9.5, select voltage-gated sodium channels, TRPA1 and TRPV1. The % of neurons and MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) for each protein target will be quantified for each level (L1, L2, L3 & L4) to test for spatial and temporal pattern of neuronal remodeling after LDP. The % of DiI+ neurons positive will be quantified.</p>
<p>Subsequent to IVD organ culture, thick (~ 500 um) IVD blocks will be immunolabeled with PGP9.5 to visualize nerve fiber density, tortuosity, connectivity, and overall length of immunolabeled structure.</p>
