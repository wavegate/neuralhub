<h3>Background & Significance</h3>

<p><b>IVD degeneration and link to back pain.</b> Low back pain affects ~85% of the population in their lifetime and is the leading cause of disability worldwide [1]. Low back pain is associated with degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) in 40% of cases [2], characterized by loss of disc height by X-ray or loss of hydration by MRI [13]. As a mostly avascular and aneural structure under healthy conditions, a role for the IVD as a pain generator remains poorly understood. Painful IVD degeneration can arise directly from nerve root impingement secondary to hypermobility, loss of disc height or osteophyte formation. Alternatively, painful IVD degeneration may arise from altered “links” or “cross-talk” between pathological IVDs and sensory nerves that transmit pain to the central nervous system (Figure A.1).</p>

<p><b>Human IVD pathology and involvement of primary sensory nerves.</b> Many groups have found increased presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) expressing sensory nerve fibers in the IVD of patients with a history of chronic back pain [14, 15]. Immunolocalization of NGF and its receptors TrkA and p75NTR (neurotrophin receptor) show increased expression in painful IVDs [16,17] and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are elevated at every stage of degeneration [18]. Further, studies have identified a role for increased monocyte infiltration into degenerate human IVDs [19,20,21], including our own work showing elevated CD68+ macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes in human degenerated IVD [22]. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediator proteins and mRNA expression in human degenerated tissues have also been widely reported, including TNF-&alpha;, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1, that are believed to be linked to the increased macrophage and lymphocyte presence [17,23,24,25]. These cytokines can support ingrowth of NGF-dependent nerve fibers into degenerated IVD suggesting one link between IVD pathology and sensory neurons that can transmit pain.</p>
<p><b>Lumbar IVD and primary sensory nerves in the rodent.</b> In both human and rat, the lumbar IVD is innervated segmentally by branches from the spinal nerves (i.e., sinuvertebral nerve) [14, 26], and multi-segmentally through rami that communicate with the sympathetic trunk (see Fig. A.2, [27,28,29]). In dozens of studies, Ohtori and co-workers have performed retrograde labeling of neurons and showed that bilateral T13-L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) innervate the ventral and dorsal portions of the rat L5-L6 IVD (see review in [28]) with findings that most innervation arises from L1 and L2 DRGs (Fig. A.3.a). They suggest that <u>nociceptive information from all portions of the L5-L6 IVD is transmitted mainly through CGRP-positive (i.e., calcitonin gene-related peptide) sensory neurons of the bilateral T13-L2 DRGs</u> (Fig. A.3.b, [30, 31,32]).</p>

<p><b>Lumbar IVD pathology and protein expression in DRG neurons.</b> IVD puncture has been widely used in rats and mice to accelerate an IVD degeneration that is associated with pain-like behavioral and sensitivity changes (see “Rat model of chronic lumbar IVD pathology” below, and Specific Aim 1). In the acute phase after lumbar IVD injury (i.e., 1 or 2 weeks), CGRP expression is elevated in L1-L6 DRGs (Fig. A.3.c,d) with a coincident but transient increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines that generally reverts to control levels by 4 weeks [33]. Intradiscal delivery of inhibitors of NGF or its receptors (TrkA or p75NTR), as well as inhibitors of BDNF, VEGF, IL-6 or TNF-&alpha;, have been shown to partially reverse the upregulation of CGRP in DRG neurons following IVD puncture [33,34,35-38] confirming intra-discal drug delivery as an effective (if undesirable) route of administration. These studies point to a pattern of transient inflammatory activity as the driver of neuropathology with acute IVD injury.</p>
<p><u>Few studies have reported changes to DRG neurons with IVD injury, beyond this increased protein expression of CGRP.</u> In one recent study, Ohtori and co-workers found the voltage- gated sodium channel Nav1.7 to have increased protein expression in lumbar DRGs at 1 and 2 weeks after IVD injury in rats [39]. Another recent study reported increased expression of ion channels, Nav1.5, 1.6 and TRPA1, in natural aging of mice to 2 years [40]. These observations suggest that aging itself leads to DRG changes that may increase potential for pain transmission in the injured animal. <u>We need to understand functional changes to DRG neurons in addition to protein-level
changes</u>, and to understand the temporal onset of these changes and their link to pain development.</p>
<p><b>Functional changes to DRG neurons in lumbar IVD pathology.</b> Several studies have sought to examine “cross-talk” between DRG neurons and IVD pathological tissue. In an early study, Aoki and co-workers cultured lumbar DRG organs in serum- free medium containing TNF-&alpha; intending to replicate the conditions of painful IVDs [31, 41]; DRGs showed increased expression of GAP43 after 48 hours as a marker of axonal growth. Haglund and co-workers incubated isolated mouse DRG neurons with human IVD conditioned media with similar findings of neurite out-growth for the painful IVD conditioned media [17]. More recently, Bowles and co-workers studied <u>DRG neuronal function</u> by measuring Ca2+ transients induced by heat in isolated DRG neurons following incubation with human IVD conditioned media [42] (see Fig. A.4); this work was designed to measure the responsiveness of the heat-sensitive ion channel, TRPV1 (vanilloid receptor type 1), an important marker of NGF-dependent sensory nerves known to innervate the IVD. This group further developed an in vitro model of IVD-DRG “cross-talk” by culturing rat DRG neurons atop human IVD tissues and studying heat-induced Ca2+ transients before and after ablation of signaling through CRISPR-mediated silencing of the IL1, IL6 or TNF receptors [43]. This work is powerful for illustrating <u>direct inflammatory-mediated cross-talk between neuronal function and IVD tissue</u>, and motivates our continued inquiry here.</p>

<p><b>Rat model of chronic lumbar IVD pathology.</b> In our own work, we induced lumbar disc puncture (LDP) in the rat L5-L5 IVD and monitored pain-related behavior and sensitivity, and DRG neuronal function as a model of IVD-DRG cross-talk [7]. The left lateral surface of the IVD was surgically approached and punctured 10x and monitored out to 20 weeks after surgery. Rats had gait and activity changes consistent with adjustments to accommodate a left-sided hindlimb pathology beginning at 8 weeks after surgery (see Fig. C.1). At 20 weeks, rats were sacrificed and DRG neurons were isolated and incubated with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Cells in culture were challenged with capsaicin (CAP) to trigger the heat-sensitive TRPV1 channel (Fig. A.5.ab). <u>We found that for DRGs obtained from LDP, both left and right-sided neurons exhibited a reduced responsiveness to capsaicin as compared to sham controls</u> (Fig. A.5.c). These findings present evidence of bilateral changes in TRPV1 activation for DRG neurons following lumbar IVD degeneration induced by LDP. <u>This is the first observation of impaired ion channel function in DRG neurons with IVD degeneration, and suggests there are many unstudied functional changes mediating sensation and pain transmission that can not be captured by immunolabeling alone.</u></p>

<p>DRG neurons have specialized functions that may change when dissociated from the intact organ [3], which limits the impact of our findings for understanding pain development in vivo. This motivates <u>our current proposal to quantify global DRG neuronal function in the intact organ</u> (Specific Aim 2) and in the living animal (Specific Aim 3) following LDP. Further, our prior study of one channel in DRG neurons falls short of studying function for other channels with known involvement in pain so we will include studies of sodium channels in Specific Aim 2.</p>
