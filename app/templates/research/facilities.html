<p><b>Tang Laboratory.</b> The Tang laboratory is housed in the Washington University Musculoskeletal Research Center (WU-MRC) and occupies approximately 1,000 square feet on the 11th floor of the Barnes Jewish Center Institute of Health (BJCIH), with separate lab rooms for mechanical testing/in vivo loading (Rm 11518), microscopy (Rm 11506), a dedicated cell/tissue culture room with laminar flow hood (Rm 11208), In addition, there is separate procedure room (Rm 11304) dedicated to human tissue processing. The Tang lab is also immediately adjacent to the core facilities of the WU-MRC (see below).</p>
<p><b>Washington University Musculoskeletal Research Center:</b> Washington University has a long record of excellence in musculoskeletal research. In 2009-present, we have been supported by an NIH/NIAMS P30 Core Center Grant that funds the Musculoskeletal Research Center (MRC). The MRC research base has 90+ members who have over $45 million of annual research support (direct costs). The hub of the MRC is the 11th floor of BJC Institute of Health (BJCIH) building, home to eleven laboratories (including the Tang Lab) focused on musculoskeletal research and three core labs. The focus of the MRC is to support and expedite the creation and analysis of animal models of relevance to musculoskeletal biology and disease. This is accomplished through three cores: Musculoskeletal Structure and Strength (Core B), Histology and morphometry (Core C), and Animal Models of Joint Injury & Disease – with emphasis on small animal musculoskeletal behavioral assessment (Core D).</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Skeletal Structure and Strength Core</b> (S. Tang, Associate Director): Available to all Washington University investigators as fee-for-service. Imaging - Two microCT scanners (described in Equipment section) are located on the 11th floor of BJCIH. These are available through post-mortem and in vivo CT scanning. Also available in the same space are specimen radiography (Faxitron) and mouse DXA (Piximus). Contained in the imaging suite are short-term animal holding (Rm 11507), specimen dissection (Rm 11508). Biomechanics – Mechanical testing facilities are also on the 11th floor of BJCIH, with test systems for a range of samples, especially suited for small animal specimen testing. Within the skeletal structure and strength core there is a surgical suite with anesthesia equipment, operating microscopy with video recording capabilities, and shadowless surgical lamps.</li>
	<li><b>Histology and Morphometry Core:</b> Histological services (embedding, sectioning, staining; plastic and paraffin) are available through In Situ Molecular Analysis Core (D. Novack, Director), also located on the 11th floor of BJCIH. The Core is staffed by technicians experienced in skeletal tissue histology.</li>
	<li><b>Animal Models of Joint Injury & Disease</b> (Y. Abu-Amer & Farshid Guilak, Co-Directors) provides standardized protocols for musculoskeletal models of joint injury and the assessment of pain behavior in these models. The Core is staffed experienced personnel for standardizing these measurements.</li>
	<li><b>The Medical School Machine Shop</b> provides customized fixture fabrication and mechanical systems repair.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Culver Laboratory.</b> Dr. Culver’s laboratory is located on the second floor of the Couch Biomedical Research Building (CBRB) and is a part of the Optical Radiology Lab (ORL) of Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology (MIR) at WUSM. The CBRB is a new 215,000 ft2, silver+ LEED-certified facility located in the heart of the Barnes-Jewish Hospital complex, only a 3 minute walk from the BJCIH. This CBRB was specifically designed to foster interdisciplinary, collaborative research amongst the Departments of Radiology, Genetics, Center for Genome Sciences & Systems Biology, Medicine, and Developmental Biology.</p>
<p><u>Optical Radiology Laboratory (ORL):</u> The ORL occupies the second floor of the CBRB and is dedicated to the development and biological evaluation of optical approaches to molecular and functional imaging in humans and small animal models of disease. The ORL includes integrated labs for molecular imaging, spectroscopy, analytical and peptide chemistry, tissue culture and histology, microscopy, optical instrumentation, and small animal imaging. Dr. Culver’s portion of the ORL floor plan (1,500 ft2) includes a 400 ft2 technology development room that houses two traditional optical tables for prototyping systems, and a 400 ft2 Functional Neuroimaging room equipped with state-of-the-art mouse surgical equipment and optimized for in vivo mouse imaging studies, Dr Culver’s laboratory also contains a 200 ft2 electro-optical machine workshop for component fabrication and system maintenance. The other 500 ft2 are dedicated to human optical neuroimaging experiments and equipment.</p>
<p><b>Biology Department Imaging Core</b> (Diane Duncan, Director). The Biology Department Imaging Core is located in very close proximity to the buildings of the McKelvey School of Engineering (0.25 mi). Of relevance here is a multiphoton confocal microscope (Leica Sp8 DIVE Multiphoton built upon DM6 CFX upright microscope) that is available to users from all schools and was used to acquire preliminary data for the current study. Microscopes of both the Biology and the Washington University Center for Cellular Imaging will be used in the proposed work.</p>
<p><b>Biomedical Engineering Department.</b> Laboratories within the Department house facilities and equipment for shared use including: <u>(1) microscopy</u> including inverted fluorescence and upright microscopes and a laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope; and <u>(2) other general facilities</u> for dissection, live animal work, refrigerators, freezers, cold rooms, autoclave and office space for many students.

<p><b>Animal</b></p>
<p>The WUSTL Division of Comparative Medicine (DCM) administers an AALAC-accredited animal facility. WUSTL operates nine facilities designed and constructed for animal housing and animal support functions. A facility is available for the Setton laboratory in the basement of Whitaker and Brauer Halls, which can house rats, mice, amphibians, insects, and larger mammals. This facility contains surgical suites and conventional animal housing including separate rooms dedicated to rodents, a veterinary treatment room, a containment suite, quarantine, animal cubicles, animal receiving, shared procedure labs, feed and bedding storage and related services. A private procedure room is available to the Setton laboratory, adjacent to animal housing and within the Whitaker Hall DCM facility, that contains all the behavioral test equipment and imaging systems proposed for use on this study.</p>
<p>A fully equipped vivarium is also situated adjacent to the Tang lab in Clinical Science Research Building
(CSRB 414). Animals may be housed at either CSRB or Danforth locations and transported via the DCM transport. The Tang laboratory also houses a procedure room and a facility for 12 hour rodent housing that will be used during CEmCT. All pre- and post-procedural assessments will occur on the Danforth campus DCM facility.</p>
<p>Optical Radiology Lab: Animal facilities and surgical suites for the ORL are located within the Functional
Neuroimaging room and the Molecular Imaging Center (MIC) of the ORL. The MIC is a ~1,600 ft2 state-of-the- art facility that also contains an animal holding room (12 hour on /12 hour off light timer, humidity sensor and alarm, and separation from other lab activities.) The surgical suites include 6 independent surgical stations to perform a variety of procedures in mice and rats. Each station includes an inhalant anesthesia set-up, surgical task lighting, air flow and temperature regulation; shared equipment includes a blood gas machine, 3 surgical dissecting scopes, 3 stereotaxic frames, and physiological monitoring equipment (blood pressure, heart rate, SO2, etc.).</p>
<p>All practices involving animals are regulated by the Institutional Animal Care Facilities and Use Committee
(IACUC) and conform to the NIH Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Five veterinarians provide animal health care and all staff veterinarians are board certified by the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine. A diagnostic laboratory staffed by two technicians provides a resource for gross and microscopic pathology, serology, hematology and clinical chemistry.</p>
