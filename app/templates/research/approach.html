<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><b>C.1. Specific Aim 1. Evaluate temporal changes to pain-related behavior & sensitivity, & molecular changes in IVD and innervating DRGs in a mouse model of lumbar disc puncture (LDP).</b></p>
<p><b>Overview and study design.</b> Lumbar disc puncture (LDP) is the most consistently used model of IVD degeneration and is associated with pain-related sensitivities (i.e., thermal sensitivity, hyperalgesia), changes in locomotion, and molecular changes to innervating DRGs in the rat and mouse (see Section A). Here we will puncture one lumbar IVD level in mice followed by longitudinal monitoring of behavior (gait, open-field, hyperalgesia) in injured and sham groups [7,44,45,46]. In this study, we choose to work with the Thy1-GCaMP6s/GP4.3 mouse model (Jackson Labs) in order to monitor the fluorescent calcium-sensitive molecule, GCaMP6s, in excitatory neurons for Specific Aims 2 and 3, as we have done in preliminary work (see Sections C.2 and C.3). For Specific Aim 1, mice will be sacrificed at varying timepoints to harvest lumbar DRGs and lumbar IVDs (injured, adjacent) for fixation and immunolabeling to detect molecular changes in both innervating DRGs and IVDs as described below. Our hypothesis is that <u>early structural changes to injured IVD will be associated with altered protein expression for CGRP and voltage-gated ion channels in L1-L4 DRGs and at later timepoints</u>; we will also test if behavioral changes at “chronic” timepoints correlate with molecular changes to lumbar DRGs at any timepoint.</p>
<p><b>C.1.A. Preliminary data in support of Specific Aim 1.</b></p>
<p><u>C.1.A.i. Behavior and sensitivity in rat IVD degeneration.</u> We have performed LDP in rats using a dorsolateral approach to induce left-sided stab of the L5-L6 IVD (Fig. A.5, [7]). Rats were evaluated longitudinally for changes to gait, locomotion and sensitivity (subset of measures are shown in Table C.1). At intermediate times after LDP (> 8 weeks), rats had altered gait (decreased duty factor and fore / hindlimb stride frequency) and locomotion changes (reduced time in motion) consistent with self-selected decreases in motion and adjustments to accommodate a left-sided pathology (Fig. C.1). This is consistent with previous studies showing altered gait in rats at shorter times to 7 weeks after surgery [47, 48]; however, our assessments to 20 weeks give evidence of “chronic” changes that are further removed from the inflammatory changes immediately post-surgery. For example, prior studies report a hindpaw hyperalgesia at short periods that we also observed in our cohort, but that resolved by 6 weeks (Fig. C.1, bottom left).</p>

<p><u>Behavior and sensitivity in mouse IVD degeneration.</u> We have previously studied behavior and sensitivity in mice in both spontaneous and surgical models of IVD degeneration. Back in 2008, we documented premature onset of IVD degeneration in Col9a1-/- mice and found reduced stride lengths and increased ground contact times (duty factor) compared to wild-type mice [44]; we also reported neuromuscular deficiencies in wire hang, Rotarod, contact righting and pole climbing, measures that some suggest is linked to spinal pain through “axial resistance” (i.e., grip strength) and impaired bending (e.g., contact righting). We note that Stone & co-workers similarly observed mice deficient in the matrix protein SPARC that develop IVD degeneration; they reported sensitivity to cold stimuli and decreased grip strength at the hindpaw with age [49, 50]. More recently, Dahia & co-workers showed aged mice (2 years) to have IVD degeneration and to have decreased grip strength as compared to younger mice [40]. Broad deletion of matrix proteins (e.g. SPARC or Col9a1) or natural aging will be associated with other pathologies such as osteopenia and arthritis, <u>so that surgical models bring unique value to understanding IVD focal pathology in pain generation.</u></p>
<p>In 2018, Stone & co-workers studied single-level LDP (L4-L5) in CD1 mice [51] and reported impaired behaviors in tail suspension and reduced motor function in a Rotarod assay. Many findings in the mouse LDP model are consistent with our findings for rat LDP and support our moving to a mouse model in the proposed study so we can work with fluorescent-reporter transgenic mice.</p>
<p><u>C.1.A.ii. LDP in the mouse.</u> Prior studies have reported morphologic changes, elevated IVD production of pro-inflammatory factors, and an axial LBP behavior following LDP in the mouse [51,52]. In our own hands, we used a left, dorsolateral surgical approach to induce a lateral anular tear in 4 month-old mice and monitored the injury over time using contrast-enhanced microCT ([53, 54], CEmCT, Fig C.2). For CEmCT, we injected 150 ?L of Ioversol at 350 mg/mL (OptiRay 350) in the mouse tail vein, allowing for 30 min of distribution followed by live microCT scanning under isoflurane anesthesia (VivaCT 40, Scanco). We localized the scans at the L5-L6 IVDs with 10?m resolution (5 kVp, 177 ?A, 300 ms integration) and examined voxel attenuation before and after Ioversol injection (Fig. C.2). Results show attenuation was marked and that the L5-L6 IVD can be discriminated from the surrounding bone.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c2.png') }}">
<p>While the lateral anular tear model was used to induce IVD instability, we now use an anterolateral approach to induce a ventral stab to the IVD to avoid trauma to the sympathetic chain. Instead of a scalpel blade, the blunt end of a Senn retractor is used to retract tissue overlying the retroperitoneum and displace the peritoneal contents to expose the anterior aspect of the L5-L6 IVD. We then puncture the IVD (4x) with a 33G needle to a depth of 0.2 mm. In this case, the puncture site is seen to be centrally located and no unilateral phenotype is associated with this procedure (Fig. C.3).</p>

<p><u>C.1.A.iii. Immunostaining of lumbar DRGs.</u> Our group has experience with retrograde labeling of DRGs with Fluorogold or the fluorescent tracer, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) (see Fig A.5) and also experience with harvesting, fixing, sectioning and immunostaining DRGs for PGP9.5, TrkA, p75NTR, NGF and TRPV1 (see Fig. C.4 and Table S1 in [7]). Thus, we have experience to obtain the proposed measures of % positively labeled DRG neurons for each target in Specific Aim 1 (Table C.2).</p>

<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/tablec2.png') }}">
<p><u>C.1.A.iv. Tissue clearing in IVD for visualization of morphology.</u> In preliminary work, we used refractive index matching [55, 56] to visualize structure in the intact, unsectioned IVD following LDP. We explored many different protocols [57, 58] before concluding that 100% dibenzyl ether (DBE) will provide the greatest optical transparency for the anulus fibrosus, while preserving tissue structure across the entire IVD (Fig. C.5, right). Here, the IVD was first dehydrated in an increasing gradient of tetrahydrofuran (THF) then placed in DBE for refractive index matching. Whole, unsectioned IVDs were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 multiphoton microscope with a solvent-compatible immersion objective (HCX APO L 20x/0.95 IMM) at 840/440nm ex/em to capture the second-harmonic generation (SHG) from collagen (Fig. C.5). We will use this novel method to measure parameters of collagen organization following LDP in the mouse for injured, adjacent and sham IVDs.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c5.png') }}">
<p><u>C.1.A.v. Visualization of nerve fiber ingrowth and vascularity in IVDs.</u> We also developed a novel method to visualize nerve fibers in thick blocks of injured IVDs. First, we decalcified a mouse motion segment following lumbar IVD injury and labeled the whole-mount for the nerve marker PGP9.5. A biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used followed by labeling with a tertiary streptavidin HRP that was developed with enzyme metallography, a process that deposits solid silver at the location of the antibody target in order to provide X-ray attenuation as well as optical contrast (EnzMet 6001, NanoProbes). Spinal units were imaged at submicron resolution with an X-ray microscope (700 nm resolution, Zeiss Versa 520), showing PGP9.5-positive staining resulting in a network-like structure that infiltrated near the posterior region (Fig. C.6); this pattern was not observed in sham IVDs. Ongoing work will focus on topographical network analyses from 3D image stacks (DragonFly, Object Research) to obtain vessel (or nerve) density, tortuosity, connectivity, and overall length of the immunolabeled structure.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c6.png') }}">
<p><b>C.1.B. Proposed work for Specific Aim 1</b></p>
<p><u>C.1.B.i. Surgical model.</u> Lumbar disc puncture (LDP) will be induced in mice (n=12 each male and female, sham or LDP) via a ventral approach at the L5-L6 lumbar level as described in Section C.1.A.ii. We will deliver 2 &micro;l solution of the fluorescent tracer, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI, 2% in 10% DMSO) to the IVD of a subset of the LDP group only, via the 33G needle and apply cyanoacrylate, allowing 5 min for drying before closing muscle and skin layers. The distribution of DiI-labeled sensory afferents matches that of Fluorogold-labeled neurons [59], but DiI will not interfere with the fluorescent signal of our GCaMP6s reporter.</p>
<p><u>C.1.B.ii. Behavior and sensitivity in the mouse LDP model.</u> All mice will be conditioned to testing apparata prior to surgery (Figure C.7). Longitudinal monitoring of mouse behavior and sensitivity will be performed to measure all parameters in Table C.1 for LDP and sham groups. Cohorts (n=12 per sex, timepoint and per group) will be sacrificed at 6, 12, 36 and 52 weeks for harvest of bilateral DRGs (L1-L4) and injured and adjacent IVDs.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c7.png') }}">
<p><u>C.1.B.iii. Longitudinal imaging of LDP mice using CEmCT.</u> Mice will be tracked for anatomic changes via CEmCT as described in Section C.1.A.ii. Under 1-3% isoflurane, mice will be imaged before and after a lateral tail vein injection of Ioversol [60] at pre-injury, 6 (sac), 12 (sac), 24, 36 (sac), 48 and 52 weeks (sac) post-injury (Figure C.7). Raw image data will be exported to DICOM for analysis via a custom program (<a href="https://github.com/WashUMRC/ContouringGUI" target="_blank">https://github.com/WashUMRC/ContouringGUI</a>) to calculate IVD heights and structural visualization in each injured and adjacent segment (OsiriX, Pixmeo).</p>
<p><u>C.1.B.iv. Immunolabeling of DRGs.</u> DRGs will be immunolabeled for presence of CGRP, PGP9.5, select voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav 1.5-1.9), TRPA1 and TRPV1 (Table C.2). The % of neurons and MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) for each protein target will be quantified for each level (L1, L2, L3 & L4) and at each timepoint (6 to 52 weeks) to test for a spatial and temporal pattern of neuronal remodeling following LDP. For LDP affected tissues, the % of DiI+ neurons positive for each target will be further quantified at each timepoint.</p>
<p><u>C.1.B.v. Histology for lumbar IVDs.</u> Intact IVDs will undergo tissue “clearing” to visualize morphology by SHG as described in Section C.1.A.iv. Morphometric measures of collagen orientation (i.e., principal texture measure, fiber density, fiber alignment) will be quantified for injured (L5-L6) and adjacent levels (L3-L4, L4-5) in subsets of mice (n=4 of 12 total) from LDP and sham groups at each timepoint.</p>
<p><u>C.1.B.vi. Immunolabeling of lumbar IVDs.</u> Thick (~ 500 &micro;m) IVD blocks from the remaining mice (n=8 per sex, group and timepoint) will be immunolabeled with PGP9.5 to visualize nerve fiber density, tortuosity, connectivity, and overall length of the immunolabeled structure (Section C.1.A.v). These parameters will be quantified for injured (L5-L6) and adjacent levels (L3-L4, L4-5) in subsets of mice (n=8) from LDP and sham at each timepoint.</p>
<p><u>C.1.B.vii. Data analysis & expected outcomes</u> <b><i>Statistical power.</i></b> Animal numbers were selected from power calculations performed by faculty in the Biostatistics Consulting Service of the Division of Biostatistics with data for IVD height in the mouse LDP model (Section C.1.A.ii), and for behavioral measures (% time, stride frequency) in rats with LDP (Section C.1.A.i). For each measure, a model was fitted that with contained fixed effect terms for Group and Time, with a quadratic response: Group, Time, Time*Time, Group*Time, Group*Time*Time, and Intercept; power calculations were performed for varying sample numbers at a significance level of 0.10. Results yielded 12 mice per group (12 each male and female, LDP and sham) to insure an ability to detect differences amongst groups and with time for each measure at > 60% power. While not powered to evaluate sex as a biological variable, the data will be collected in both male and female mice for separate analyses.</p>
<p><b><i>Hypothesis testing.</i></b> In order to test for temporal and spatial changes in all measures following LDP, we will place continuous measures for each assay into specimen-specific arrays segmented by Group and Time: for example, array1 = {IVD morphometry via CEmCT, SHG, and IVD nerve fiber labeling}, array2 = {L1 DRG %+ and MFI for all targets} and array3 = [% time traveling, hyperalgesia, latency…..]). Measures within each array will be scaled by their respective standard deviation across all subjects prior to performing K-means clustering to identify patterns in time, treatment and level. ANOVA will be used to test for statistical differences in individual measures amongst clusters and to identify measures that do not contribute to variability in the data. Normality of the data will be verified by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, prior to performing ANOVA as appropriate. We expect that some measures associated with LDP may cluster with sham at early timepoints in a majority of subjects at short times (e.g., 6 weeks) but not at later times (or the reverse). We have designed experiments in consultation with Biostatistics Consulting Service and will consult with them on all analyses.</p>
<p><b><i>Correlative analyses.</i></b> In order to test for predictive relationships between measures in injured IVD (e.g., array1 above) and protein expression in lumbar DRGs, we will construct full-factorial generalized linear models (GLM, Matlab) with a linear dependence of each DRG measure upon IVD array measures for all segments across time. As one example, results will enable us to test if an early loss of disc height or collagen disorganization (i.e., 6 weeks) in the LDP segment is related to molecular changes in the L4 DRG at later times after surgery. We will further construct GLM with a linear dependence of each behavior and sensitivity measure upon DRG array data to test for relationships between behavior and sensitivity and DRG neuronal remodeling with LDP. <u>We have experience with all proposed methods and expect few challenges with Specific Aim 1.</u></p>

<p><b>Specific Aim 2. Evaluate temporal changes to action potential-driven Ca2+ transients in lumbar DRG neurons following LDP in a mouse model.</b></p>

<p><b>Overview and study design.</b> Many studies have documented <u>altered protein expression</u> for TRPV1, CGRP, substance P and other neuronal markers in DRGs following natural aging or induction of IVD degeneration in animal models. <u>Only our study of isolated DRG neurons has documented functional changes to DRG neurons in IVD degeneration</u>, seen as decreased incidence of Ca2+ transients following challenge with a capsaicin agonist (Fig. A.5, [7]). In addition to the obvious limitation that we studied activation of only one ion channel, <u>dissociation of cells from intact DRGs will affect their excitability and cause loss of neighboring interactions that affect neuronal activation</u> [3, 4, 5, 6]. Here we will use organotypic cultures of DRGs exposed to electric field stimulation (EFS) to measure the generation of action potentials that are relevant to pain transmission. As sodium channels are principal contributors to generation of action potentials, we can reveal a role for specific Nav1.x channels in DRG neurons using pharmacologic blocking agents. By using EFS [8, 61], we will report voltage-dependent neurons responding and peak Ca2+ amplitudes for individual and neighboring DRG neurons. Ca2+ transients will serve as a surrogate measure of action potential generation and will reveal the nature of DRG functional changes with IVD degeneration after LDP. As vital organs will be obtained from animals in this cohort, we will also quantify the profile of cytokines secreted by IVDs isolated and cultured in vitro.</p>

<p><b>C.2.A. Preliminary data in support of Specific Aim 2.</b></p>
<p>C.2.A.i. DRG organ culture and electric field stimulation (EFS). Prior studies have used EFS to study the
generation of action potentials in dissociated cells and documented a cell-specific dependence of depolarization on pulse duration, frequency and voltage of the applied potential [e.g., Fig. C.8, [8,9]). Results show that individual neurons have cell-specific voltage thresholds for activation, and that the amplitude of Ca2+ response depends on the number of action potentials rather than applied voltage [62, 8]. Organ culture has distinct advantages over harvesting dissociated cells, and EFS can reproduce many of these same behaviors for individual neurons within the intact DRG organ. We isolated intact lumbar DRGs from naïve Thy1-GCaMP6s mice for culture (Fig. C.9, Neurobasal A medium supplemented 1% pen/strep, 2% B27, 5% FBS, and 1% Glutamax). DRGs were placed in the center of a recording chamber (RC-26, Warner), secured by a slide anchor and nylon mesh, and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at a rate of 2 mL/min. Two electrodes connected to a pulse generator (Grass SD9) were inserted at opposite ends of the chamber, and DRGs were stimulated with bipolar square pulses (1ms, 10Hz, 19s rest) at voltage amplitude from 1-100V. GCaMP6S fluorescence was imaged at 488/510 nm with a spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti2).</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c8.png') }}">
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c9.png') }}">
<p>As observed in Fig. C.10, we obtained a histogram of DRG neuron threshold voltages for the intact organ. Generation of an action potential as estimated by Ca2+ signal increases with applied voltage amplitude as shown. <u>We propose that the baseline threshold voltage (10% of cells responding) and IC50 threshold voltage for LDP DRGs will differ from that of sham, and that the differences observed in L1, L2, L3 and L4 DRGs will have varied onset with time past LDP injury.</u></p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c10.png') }}">
<p><u>C.2.A.ii. TTX alters EFS-induced action potential measured by Ca2+ transients.</u> We evaluated dependence of action potential generation upon Nav1.x channels by incubating DRG organs with a pan-Nav channel blocker (tetrodotoxin, TTX 50nM) and repeating experiments of C.2.A.i. A dose-response curve was generated for concentrations of 0.5-100 nM TTX followed by 5 minutes of equilibration before repeating EFS stimulation. Results shown in Fig. C.10 (right) shown that TTX reduces numbers of cells responding to EFS as well as peak Ca2+ response. This approach will be used for studies in Specific Aim 2 with TTX and select ion channel inhibitors to identify precise information about functional remodeling in DRG neurons with LDP injury.</p>
<p><u>C.2.A.iii. IVD organ culture for collection and characterization of conditioned media.</u> We have cultured mouse IVD organs for up to 21-days post-sacrifice, in order to characterize NF&kappa;B-luc reporter activity and release of secreted cytokines from injured mouse IVDs [63]. In this work, motion segments (bone-IVD-bone) were isolated from the lumbar regions of Balb/C (control) or NF-&kappa;B-luc reporter mice, and cultured in 24-well plates with each well containing 2 ml of 1:1 DMEM:F12 (with 20% FBS and 1% pen-strep). A subset of segments received an anterior stab injury to the IVD to induce degeneration. As shown in Fig. C.11, elevated IL-6 (mouse IL-6 ELISA, Affymetrix) and NF&kappa;B transcriptional activity (IVIS100, Perkin-Elmer) were observed as early as 1 day following IVD injury [63, 64]. Samples survived in culture and continued to secrete cytokines out to 21 days after sacrifice. Here we propose to use this approach to collect media from injured and adjacent IVDs harvested from sham and LDP spines, and assay that media for key cytokines and neurotrophins (Section C.2.B.iii).</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c11.png') }}">
<p><b>C.2.B. Proposed work for Specific Aim 2.</b></p>
<p><u>C.2.B.i. EFS-induced action potentials measured by GCaMP6s.</u> We will use methods of Section C.2.A.i to visualize EFS-induced Ca2+ transients in DRG organs obtained from Thy1-GCamp6s mice. Here, mice will undergo surgery as described in Specific Aim 1 (n=12 per group, sex and timepoint) and cohorts will be sacrificed for fresh harvest of bilateral DRGs (L1-L4, see Figure C.12). DRGs will be exposed to EFS to measure parameters of baseline fluorescence F0 (20 min) and amplitude change over time (&Delta;F) via confocal microscopy as described. We expect to obtain more than 100 responding neurons per DRG and plot a histogram of cell responses versus voltage to calculate a baseline threshold voltage (V10%) and IC50 for threshold voltage (V50%) from a numerical fit. We will also calculate total numbers of cells and peak &Delta;F/F0 at maximum voltage and % of neighboring cells in synchrony. Finally, we will measure the sizes associated with each neuron (ROI) to distinguish responses for small and medium sized neurons (< 50 microns) from those for larger neurons.</p>
<p><u>C.2.B.ii. Pharmacologic inhibition of EFS-induced action potentials.</u> For each group and at each time, we will have left and right DRGs available for culture at each level (2 x 4 levels = 8 for each mouse). All 8 DRGs will be studied as described above and then randomly assigned to one of 3 groups receiving a pharmacologic inhibitor: (1) Nav1.7 (PF-05089771, Sigma Aldrich); (2) Nav1.8 (PF-01247324); (3) TTX inhibiting all tetradotoxin-sensitive sodium channels). Dose-response curves will be obtained as described in Section C.2.A.ii to find the concentration for attenuation of median ?F/F0 in all ROI by 20% or more (at max EFS voltage); this estimate is used as multiple voltage-gated sodium channels may contribute to the generation of an action potential so that attenuations at higher levels may indicate cell death. DRGs will then be re-incubated with artificial CSF and the experiment repeated to ensure that no experiment-induced cell damage occurred.</p>
<p><u>C.2.B.iii. IVD culture for collection and characterization of conditioned media.</u> We will obtain IVD from the injured (L5-L6) and two adjacent lumbar levels (L3-L4, L4-L5) and culture as described in Section C.2.A.iii. Media will be collected at 48 hours and frozen at -80°C until analyzed via multiplex assay for simultaneous quantification of 13 mouse cytokines (IL-1α/β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL- 17A, IL-23, IL-27, MCP-1, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF- α, and GM-CSF; LegendPLEX, BioLegend). This assay panel has been validated in our hands by detecting expected changes in biological samples.</p>
<p>C.2.B.iv Statistical analysis & expected outcomes. Specimen-specific measures of baseline EFS stimulation (V10%, V50%, total cell number at Vmax, peak ?F/F0 at Vmax, and % of cells with neighboring synchronous response) will be analyzed for K-means clustering as described in Section C.1.B.vii (Hypothesis testing). ANOVA will be used as described to test for DRG neuronal remodeling post-surgery in either LDP or sham groups and to reveal the spatial involvement of L1 to L4 DRGs. Specimen-specific measures of secreted cytokines from cultured IVDs will be similarly analyzed via K-means clustering and ANOVA. We expect to identify a pattern for temporal change in some, but not all secreted cytokines and for LDP at some timepoints, but not sham.</p>
<p>Separately, a two-factor MANOVA will be used to test for differences in % attenuation of median &Delta;F/F0
(for each of three Nav1.x inhibitors) with time post-surgery and across lumbar levels. This will allow us to test if specific Nav1.x remodeling is involved in the DRG changes following surgery in either LDP or sham groups.</p>

<p><b>Specific Aim 3. Evaluate sensory stimuli-induced responses in DRG neurons in living mice using in vivo fluorescence microscopy.</b></p>
<p><b>Overview and study design.</b> Studies have linked the development of musculoskeletal disease to pain and sensitivity using electrophysiology to measure synaptic transmission in the spinal cord of living animals following injury (e.g., facet joint injury by Winkelstein & co-workers, [65, 66]). More recently, intra-cellular Ca2+ indicators, principally genetically encoded fluorescent proteins (e.g., GCaMPs) have been used in living animals to quantify neuronal activation in the brain [67], the spinal cord [68] and the DRG [3, 5, 12, 69]. In a first demonstration of methods using GCaMP3 expression under control of the Pirt-promoter, Dong and co-workers measured Ca2+ transients in response to pressure and capsaicin at the hindpaw (see example in Fig. C.13, [69]). They and others have used this method to show when sensory neurons are polymodal (responsive to multiple or selective stimuli), whether neurons respond in isolation or follow their nearest neighbor, and if neuronal function is sensitive to systemic delivery of lidocaine, pentobarbital, as examples. One consistent theme is that inflammatory (Freud’s adjuvant, CFA) or tissue injury (nerve constriction) can induce changes in sensory neuron responses to cold or hot, to touch or pressure, but not to all stimuli (see Fig. C.14).</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c13.png') }}">
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c14.png') }}">
<p>Motivation for our proposed work comes from the work of Malfait, Dong and co-workers, who documented DRG neuronal remodeling following surgery to induce knee joint osteoarthritis [10]. At 8 weeks after knee joint injury, pinch and knee twist caused activation of higher numbers of L4 DRG neurons in the Pirt-GCaMP3+ mice, without measurable differences in Ca2+ amplitude. Further, they identified a role for neighboring neurons as having the greatest remodeling response to osteoarthritis, suggesting that injury induced a “nearest neighbor” response. <u>Here we propose to use two-photon microscopy (TPM) with real-time motion correction [67] to identify DRG sensory neurons responding to in vivo stimulation of brush, pinch, heat and cold in living mice in the LDP and sham-operated groups.</u> Data for peak Ca2+ neuronal response, nearest neighbor analyses, and polymodality will be compared between LDP and sham groups and at short (6 weeks) and long periods (36 weeks) after LDP injury. These studies will enable us to infer a pattern for acute and chronic changes in lumbar DRGs in response to IVD degeneration.</p>
<p><b>C.3.A. Preliminary data in support of Specific Aim 3.</b></p>
<p><u>C.3.A.i. Imaging neuronal excitation in DRGs of Thy1-GCaMP6s mice.</u> As shown in Fig C.9, we and others [5] have found high levels of GCaMP expression in sensory neurons of lumbar DRGs under control of the Thy1 promoter. Here, we performed a dorsal exposure and laminotomy to expose the L2 DRG in Thy1-GCaMP6s mice (Jackson Labs), following procedures outlined by Dong & co-workers [10, 69]. The exposed DRG was irrigated with aCSF and adjacent spinous processes were clamped and elevated above the table to minimize motion artifact (see Fig. C.15). A portable microscope (Inscopix) was used to visualize the exposed DRG and to obtain longitudinal images of Ca2+ transients following hindpaw exposure to pinch, touch, hot and cold (Fig. C.15, acetone shown). While this study demonstrated an ability to capture sensory neuron activation via imaging in the Thy1-GCaMP6s mice, poor resolution due to out-of-plane signal prohibits imaging of single neuronal responses. <u>For this reason, we will work with TPM imaging of Thy1-GCaMP6s labeled neurons moving forward.</u></p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c15.png') }}">
<p><u>C.3.A.ii. Large Field of View Two-Photon Microscope (TPM).</u> The Culver laboratory has developed a large field of view two photon microscope (LF-TPM) in order to image Ca2+ activity in vivo (see Fig. C.16, [67]). This system is capable of imaging fields of view as large as 5 mm using an NA=0.28 (4x) objective, or as high a resolution as 0.5 microns when using an NA=0.9 (20x) objective.</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static',filename='img/drg/c16.png') }}">
<p>To test feasibility of in vivo imaging, we imaged the cerebral vasculature of the mouse cortex (Fig C.17). A large dual hemisphere craniotomy was performed [70, 71]. Vessels were imaged after tail vein injection of 5% solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (Fig. C.17A-B). Here we show a maximum projection image due to curvature of the mouse head. More recently, we established the feasibility of imaging spontaneous activity in individual neurons of the Thy1-GCaMP6s mice (Fig. C.18 & C.19) using a 20x objective and a permanent cranial window that allows for longitudinal imaging.</p>

<p><u>C.3.A.iii. Real-time motion compensation.</u> We have addressed imaging with motions due to breathing by incorporating an active tracking system that adjusts the effective axial position of the objective as the mouse moves, using a feedback control system [72]. The movement compensation system (Fig. C.20) consists of a light emitting diode (LED, ATF4, WDI Inc.), imaging sensor (sCMOS, Thorlabs), and an electrically tunable lens (ETL). Light from the LED enters the optical pathway by reflecting off a dichroic mirror with cutoff wavelength of 730nm. The illumination pattern of the LED is a hemi-circle that is directed obliquely to the rear of the objective lens; depending on the axial position of the mouse relative to the objective, the hemi-circle will have different orientations. Light reflected from the LED is then collected and measured by a CCD detector, and used as a control signal sent to the ETL to compensate for the motion of the mouse [72].</p>

<p><b>C.3.B. Proposed work for Specific Aim 3</b></p>
<p><u>C.3.B.i. Behavioral assessments and surgical plan.</u> A total of 96 Thy1-GCaMP6s mice will undergo surgery to induce LDP (n=24 each male, female) or sham-control (n=24 each male, female) as described for Aims 1 and 2. Using a cross-sectional design, we will image mice at short (6 weeks) and long periods (36 weeks) post injury. Mice will be conditioned to behavioral and sensitivity testing pre-operatively, and at longitudinal periods up to sacrifice to obtain measures of a subset of parameters from Table C.1 (to be selected from the set that best
separates LDP and sham). Mice will then undergo TPM imaging of GCaMP6s activity in exposed DRG during acute non-survival imaging as described here.</p>
<p><u>C.3.B.ii. Posterior exposure of lumbar DRGs for in vivo imaging.</u> Under isoflurane anesthesia, the mouse will be placed in a prone position and exposure of right or left-sided L1-L2 DRGs will be performed via a posterior approach and laminotomy. We will affix our custom-built window chamber to adjacent spinous processes (Fig. C.21) to enable our attachment of a locking forceps spinous clamp and micromanipulator upon the microscope stage. DRGs will be overlaid with an aqueous gel and a coverslip placed atop the DRG and window chamber as has been described previously [5]. In our hands, recovery from chamber implantation is complete by 4-6 days so in vivo imaging will be performed after that period.</p>

<p><u>C.3.B.iii. In vivo imaging.</u> Following administration of ketamine/xylazine (86.9 mg/kg / 13.4 mg/kg), the mouse will be rigidly fixed to the micromanipulator atop the microscope stage through the DRG window, as performed by others [5]. The 20x objective for the TPM will be placed in near contact with the coverslip and animal positioning will be performed via positioning with micromanipulators to establish optical clarity. For a period of 10 minutes, we will collect high signal to noise images of baseline Thy1-GCaMP6s signal in the exposed DRGs. These will be used to segment the imaging volume into individual neurons or ROI following the procedures of [73].</p>
<p>Mice will then be imaged during a session that includes the following stimulations to the hindpaw (same size as imaged DRG): heat (50°C, 15s, MouseCat thermal meter), cold (ice block in contact with paw, 15s), light touch (5 gf von Frey filament) or pinch (paw pressure apparatus, SD Instr) with 3 minutes of recovery between stimuli. This battery of stimuli will be repeated 3x in block order on the same hindpaw; an additional block will be applied to the contralateral hindpaw (for exploratory purposes). We will image time course of fluorescence activation for each ROI and average responses over 3 replicates of each stimuli. Parameters to be measured for each DRG and stimuli are number and % of total activated neurons, numbers responding to multiple stimuli (polymodality), time to peak &Delta;F/F0 and numbers of neurons in synchrony with nearest neighbor.</p>
<p><u>C.3.B.iv Statistical analysis & expected outcomes.</u> At each of two timepoints and within each sex, the complete set of parameters obtained from in vivo imaging for each DRG will be tested for differences between LDP and sham groups via one factor MANOVA. Post-hoc Bonferroni’s correction will be used to test all pair-wise comparisons. This will allow us to determine if LDP induces remodeling of stimuli-specific sensory neurons at the DRG at each time (6 or 36 weeks).</p>
<p>We further seek to test for relationships between mouse-specific pain-related behavior and sensitivity measures in the awake mouse, and the in vivo recordings of sensory stimuli-induced GCaMP6s in the anesthetized mouse. For subsets of behavioral and sensitivity parameters at each timepoint (e.g., 50% paw withdrawal threshold), we will construct a full-factorial generalized linear model (GLM) with a linear dependence of mouse-specific behavior or
sensitivity measure upon in vivo imaging measures across all groups and time points (see Section C.1.B.viii, Statistical analyses). We believe we can perform in vivo imaging of the DRG using a chronically implanted window and TPM based on our ability to image DRG with the Inscopix system, and mouse brain with TPM and a chronic window. To manage the scope of this Aim, we reduced our timepoints and numbers of behavior and sensitivity measures (see Timeline).</p>
