<h3>Vertebrate animals</h3>

<p><b>1) Description of Procedures</b></p>
<p><u>Statistical power calculations.</u> Animal numbers were selected from power calculations performed with data for structural changes (IVD height) in the mouse LDP model (Walk et al. 2019), and for changes in behavioral assessments (%time, stride frequency) reported for rats with LDP (Leimer et al. 2019). In each case, a model was fitted that contained fixed effect terms for Group and Time, with Time treated as a continuous variable with a quadratic response: Group, Time, Time*Time, Group*Time, Group*Time*Time, and Intercept, and power calculations were performed for varying sample numbers for each parameter at a significance level of 0.10. Results indicate that 12 mice per experimental group (12 each male and female) will ensure an ability to detect differences amongst groups and with time with no less than 60% power. This power calculation was not performed with sex as a biological variable; however, the data will be collected in both male and female mice for separate analysis. For this reason, numbers below are based on this estimate.</p>
<p>A total of 480 mice (strain C57BL/6J-Tg(Thy1-GCaMP6s)GP4.3Dkim/J) termed "Thy1-GCaMP”, (240
each male and female), age 4-6 weeks, will be needed to complete the proposed work. For Specific Aim 1 (n = 192) and Specific Aim 3 (n = 96), mice will be housed in the Whitaker Hall animal facility of the Division of Comparative Medicine (DCM) where they will be aged until 8 weeks. During the period from 4-8 weeks of age, mice will be acclimated to all behavioral test equipment (see non-surgical procedures below). All imaging and test parameters will be collected on mice during 1-2 days before the surgical procedure to induce lumbar disc puncture (LDP), and at intervals as shown in Table I. Mice will be sacrificed following the schedule shown in Table I, and tissue will be immediately harvested for ex vivo imaging and post-processing.</p>
<p><i>Surgical procedure to induce lumbar disc puncture (LDP)</i></p>
<p>At 8 weeks of age, all mice will undergo a procedure for LDP as performed previously. Mice will be maintained under 1-3% isoflurane anesthesia via nose cone. First, we mark the incision site as ~ ¼” below, ¾” above the iliac wings and wash and prep appropriately. With a #11 blade, a vertebral incision is made over the abdomen vertically. Subcutaneous flaps (using tenotomy scissors) superficial to the abdominal muscle will be made, followed by gentle lifting of the abdominal musculature with forceps. This procedure facilitates closure. The peritoneal cavity is identified and the animal rotated on its right side to allow for left lateral displacement of the viscera, irrigating in saline-moistened sterile gauze. Using the blunt end of a Senn retractor, tissue overlying the retroperitoneum will be dissected under microscopic visualization and the aorta and IVC will be visualized. Gentle scraping of the aspects lateral (left) to this structure will allow for visualization of the vertebral bodies and identification of the L5-L6 IVD. In the LDP group, the most anterior aspect of the L5-6 IVD will be punctured 4x times with a 33G needle to a depth of 0.2mm; in the sham group, no instrument directly touches any IVD. When needed, we deliver 2 ?l solution of DiI (2% in 10% DMSO) to the punctured IVD via the 33G needle and close with cyanoacrylate, allowing 5 min for drying before closing. The abdominal muscles will be closed with 3-0 vicryl, then skin with 4-0 nylon suture.</p>
<p>Mice will be allowed to recover upon a heating pad, returned to their cages and returned to housing within the Whitaker facility. All mice will receive topical analgesia for 1-3 days. Mice required for longitudinal imaging via microCT (Specific Aim 1) will be housed at the School of Medicine DCM facility both pre-operatively and post- operatively for the duration. Mice required for in vivo imaging (Specific Aim 3) will be transferred to the School of Medicine DCM facility after behavioral testing and prior to the initiation of the described experiments.</p>
<p><i>Note that we request funds to support the purchase of a glass bead sterilizer and some calibrated thermal and pinch testing apparata to support work with animals here.</i></p>
<p><i>Surgical in vivo imaging procedures</i></p>
<p>For studies in Specific Aim 3, mice will undergo surgery to induce LDP (or sham) as described above, be followed longitudinally for non-surgical assessments (as described below). One week prior to planned in vivo imaging at the School of Medicine (Culver laboratory), mice will undergo a procedure for chronic DRG window implantation. Mice will be maintained under 1-3% isoflurane anesthesia via nose cone. Mice will be placed on a heating pad in a prone position and shaved and washed in the dorsal mid-thoracic to lumbar region. With a #15 blade, a posterior incision will be made vertically and subcutaneous flaps and longitudinal musculature in the mid-thoracic region will be resected to approach the lamina of the L1 or L2 vertebral body (left or right side should not matter). Kerrison rongeurs will be used to remove the lamina and our custom-built DRG window chamber will be implanted across the exposed foramen (see Figure C.22). The window chamber will be affixed to stabilizing clamps and micromanipulator upon the microscope stage to minimize motion artifact due to breathing. The DRG will be overlaid with an aqueous gel and a cover slip, and the animal will be allowed to recover following muscle and skin closure as described above. The wound site and cover slip will be monitored for 4-6 days; we anticipate an initial clouding and then clearing of the viewing chamber as macrophage infiltration eventually subsides, as we have seen previously with chronic cranial window placement.</p>
<p>No less than 5 days following window placement, the mice will then be transferred to the School of Medicine DCM facility by DCM transport. Mice will be transported to the Culver laboratory (in sets of 2 animals per day) for less than 12 hours of housing. Under sedation and anesthesia by ketamine and xylazine (86.9 mg/kg ketamine, 13.4 mg/kg xylazine, ip), the animal will be placed upon the microscope stage and the DRG chamber clamp will be affixed to the micromanipulator allowing for immobilization of the spinal column and gentle rotation to allow for orthogonal viewing of the coverslip. The microscope objective will then be placed in proximity with the coverslip to visualize the field of view (FOV, ~ 2 mm x 2 mm). Spontaneous neuronal activity will be recorded for a period of 3 min to identify and number single neurons as regions-of-interest (ROI).</p>
<p>Mice will be imaged for the following stimuli applied to hindpaw (same size as imaged DRG): heat (50°C,
15s, MouseCat thermal meter), cold (ice block in contact with paw, 15s), light touch (5 gf von Frey filament) or pinch (paw pressure apparatus, SD Instr) with 3 minutes of recovery between stimuli. This battery of stimuli will be repeated 3x in block order on the same hindpaw; an additional block will be applied to the contralateral hindpaw (not to be used in statistical analyses). We will image time course of fluorescence activation for each ROI and average responses for each ROI over 3 replicates of each stimuli. Parameters to be measured for each DRG and stimuli are number and % of total activated neurons, numbers responding to multiple stimuli (polymodality), time to peak ?F/F0 and numbers of neurons in synchrony with nearest neighbor.</p>
<p>Mice will be sacrificed at the end of this experiment (see below) and organs harvested for use as described in Specific Aims 1 and 2.</p>
<p><i>Non-surgical behavioral procedures</i></p>
<p>Functional and symptomatic assessments will be conducted “pre-op” and again periodically as indicated in Table I. In most cases, assessments will be performed at 3 or 4 week intervals to insure consistency of animal behaviors after the conditioning period; however, data may be used at only the time-points denoted by an asterisk for the purposes of statistical comparisons and data analysis in each Specific Aim (see Table I). The injury risk is low in every functional and symptomatic assessment; however, we will use a sequence of tests that advances from the least stressful/lowest injury risk to the most stressful/highest injury risk [open field ≤ mechanical sensitivity ≤ thermal sensitivity ≤ gait]; imaging tests will be performed on separate days. Should unexpected injury occur in any animal, that animal would be excluded from any additional tests. We have great experience with these procedures and have been approved to perform all methods upon mice currently through the Washington University IACUC.</p>
<p><u><i>Gait:</i></u> Gait analysis will be performed on the DigiGaitTM system (Mouse Specifics, Inc.) to be housed within the Whitaker facility. Prior to testing, mice will be habituated to walk on the treadmill over 6 days after 12 weeks of age. Preoperatively and at each time point, mice will be placed upon the treadmill with a clear tread belt for optical recording, which will be ramped up to run at 1 of 2 controlled speeds (10 and 15 cm/s). Mice will ambulate at each speed for 20s while ventral high-speed video (100 fps) is captured of the mouse footprints through the clear tread belt. Mice will be continuously monitored, in the case of a mouse being unable to maintain a walk on the belt, a stop switch is connected to the treadmill which stops the belt immediately.</p>
<p><u><i>Mechanical sensitivity at paw:</i></u> To quantify pain-related symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in the mouse, we will assess mechanical sensitivity at the paw. Mice will be acclimated to a wire-bottom cage over a 6 day interval (~30 minutes in the cage). Following acclimation, the indenter of an automated von Frey tester (Model EVF4-S, Bioseb) will be pressed against the plantar region of the mouse left and right hind paw; the device will record the force prior to paw withdrawal. This paradigm will be repeated for 4 trials per hind limb and the withdrawal force will be recorded, and eventually analyzed following normalization of pre-operative values for each animal and each paw. <i>This instrument is available in each DCM facility.</i></p>
<p><u><i>Mechanical sensitivity at lumbar region:</i></u> To quantify pain-related symptoms at the lumbar region in the mouse, we will assess analgesia using an automated analgesia meter (SMALLGO, Bioseb). Mice will be held while wrapped in a warm towel so that their head is covered and their mid-body region is exposed. The indenter of the algesiometer will be placed above the posterior region corresponding to the incision site and the pressure increased until the animal vocalizes or withdraws. This paradigm will be repeated for 2 trials per day listed in Table I, and the withdrawal force will be recorded. This withdrawal force will be normalized by pre-operative values for each animal at each timepoint. <i>This instrument is available in each DCM facility.</i></p>
<p><u><i>Thermal sensitivity:</i></u> We will use an automated thermal hyperalgesia meter (IITC Inc.) to apply heat to the mouse paws as an indicator of peripheral neuropathy. Mice will be acclimated to a glass floor cage over a 6-day interval (~30 minutes per session). Following acclimation, a focused light source from underneath the cage will apply heat to the plantar region of the left and right hind paw. The time to withdrawal from the heat source (latency) will be recorded. The test will be repeated every 5 minutes, alternating between the left and right paws (10 minutes between heat exposures on the same paw); in total, 3 trials will be performed per rat per hind foot (6 exposures per animal) to calculate an average that is normalized by pre-op values. The device used to apply heat automatically shuts off after 20 seconds of exposure, thus the tissue injury risk is low for this test. <i>This instrument is available in each DCM facility.</i></p>
<p>Cold sensitivity will be measured in the same caging as that used for mechanical sensitivity, with a modified ice block exposure test at each hindpaw as described. A syringe block of ice will be applied to left and right hind paws within the caging until withdrawal. The time to withdrawal from the cold exposure will be recorded following ice block application.</p>
<p><u><i>Open field testing:</i></u> Freely selected activity will be assessed by tracking mouse movement within a black acrylic arena (custom-built, 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm) for 30 minutes during the dark portion of a 12 hour light-dark cycle; all tracking will be performed without the presence of investigators or other personnel and with illumination by red light. Movement will be recorded (Sony Handycam HDR-CX405, Sony Corp, New York, NY) and analyzed (EthoVision, Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA) to determine % time spent traveling and % time spent in center 1/4th of the arena. <i>This instrument will be available in each DCM facility.</i></p>
<p><i>Ex vivo imaging procedures</i></p>
<p><u><i>Contrast-Enhanced microCT:</i></u> To monitor the structural of changes of the intervertebral disc, animals will be imaged using contrast-enhanced microCT. A pre-operative scan will be acquired, as well as time-points at 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-, and 52- week following the surgery. Mice will be anesthetized with isoflurane via nose cone (1-3%). Ioversol, a biocompatible, hydrophilic contrast agent will be delivered to each animal through tail-vein injection at 8 mL / kg of Ioversol (Optiray 350). Optimal attenuation of the intervertebral disc is typically observed 30 mins following the injection, and the microCT imaging typically takes 20 mins to acquire a 10 um resolution scan in the region of interest. Following imaging, animals will be allowed to recover promptly after imaging following placement on a heating pad and return to their cages.</p>
<p><u><i>Digital X-ray Imaging.</i></u> Planar X-rays of the whole mouse will be obtained via digital X-ray (Faxitron Multifocus) immediately after the surgery to confirm the location and degree of injury. Mice will be anesthetized with isoflurane via nose cone (1-3%) and placed within the Faxitron chamber for imaging. Animals will be allowed to recover promptly after imaging following placement on a heating pad and return to their cages.</p>

<p><b>2) Justifications</b></p>
<p><i>Justification of Species.</i> We seek to measure the functional remodeling of DRG neurons in a nearly intact state, as neighboring neurons have been shown to influence each other in neuronal remodeling. Mutant mice carrying a gene for the fluorescent Ca2+ reporter, GCaMP6 allow a non-contact manner to measure neuronal action potentials following electric field stimulation (Specific Aim 2) or sensory input (Specific Aim 3) without use of exogeneous instruments or dyes. We can only study the cross-talk between tissue damage (intervertebral disc degeneration) and DRGs in a living model system, and mice are the only species to have been bred with this Ca2+ reporter transgene. This need restricted our selection to use of the mouse model.</p>
<p><b>3) Minimization of Pain and Distress</b></p>
<p>Care will be taken to avoid and minimize pain, distress, and discomfort during all procedures. During surgery, mice will be anesthetized via isoflurane followed by recovery upon a heating pad. In the immediate post- procedure period and for the following 3 days, mice will be administered buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) every 12 hrs for 72 hrs and on as needed basis for a total of 3 days. Opthalmic ointment will be applied to eyes if recovery is extended beyond 15 minutes. Mice will be monitored daily for 7 days, followed by every 2-3 days, for signs of wound healing, behavioral changes (aggression, guarding, hiding), licking, biting, and changes in posture or ambulation (tense, tucked-up, stiff gait) or activity level. Evidence of any concerns or behavioral changes will be cause for a veterinary consultation.</p>
<p>Animal cages will be provided with gelpaks as well as water ad libitum to insure hydration in case animals
experience difficulty with ambulation. Animals will be weighed at each time point and a loss of more than 15% of body weight will be considered a humane endpoint.</p>
<p>X-ray imaging will be performed under isoflurane (1-3%) anesthesia, which will limit distress during imaging. Animals will be allowed to recover promptly after imaging following placement on a heating pad.</p>
<p><b>4) Euthanasia</b></p>
<p>Animals will receive an injection of euthanasia solution (150 mg/kg, IP; Med-Pharmex, Pomona, CA) and then exsanguinated via transcardial perfusion with 1X PBS (Gibco Life Technologies, Waltham, MA) by peristaltic pump. Mice will be dissected for immediate organ removal (i.e., DRG and IVD isolation for Specific Aim 2), or continuously perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS in the animal organs are targeted for histology/immunolabeling (Specific Aim 1). This method is consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association.</p>
