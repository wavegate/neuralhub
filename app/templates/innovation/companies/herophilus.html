The current neuroscience drug discovery approach has been largely unsuccessful, with few disease modifying therapies available for most brain diseases.

We are reinventing neuro drug discovery by combining human brain models, scaled biology and machine learning to decode brain disease, from genetics to neural computation. We harness the resulting deep biological insights to systematically discover and develop novel drugs with greater therapeutic potential.
