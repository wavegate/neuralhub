Nia Therapeutics is developing precision brain stimulation therapies to treat memory loss due to brain injury and degenerative disease. Niaâ€™s technology was developed at the University of Pennsylvania with funding from DARPA. Our team has shown that when stimulation is delivered to a specific part of the brain (the temporal lobe) when memory is predicted to fail, it can significantly improve memory performance.
