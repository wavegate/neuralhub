Galvani is developing therapies to treat disease through implant-based direct modulation of specific neural signals to organs central in chronic disease. These therapies are designed to be safe, precise in their therapeutic effect, and minimally invasive in their delivery through use of small and efficient wireless electronics and keyhole surgery. Connected software will ensure that patients and physicians can effectively control and optimise the therapy.
