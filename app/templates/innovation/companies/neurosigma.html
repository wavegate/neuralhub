NeuroSigma is researching trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) as a novel neuromodulation therapy for a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. TNS was invented at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and NeuroSigma is the exclusive worldwide licensee of UCLA's intellectual property portfolio related to this technology.

NeuroSigma's research efforts are lead by an experienced team of doctors, scientists, and engineers. Use of TNS as a therapeutic platform is supported by over a decade of both basic science and clinical studies. To date, TNS has been investigated as a therapy for epilepsy, depression, attention deficity hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). NeuroSigma is committed to making this innovative therapy available to patients worldwide.
